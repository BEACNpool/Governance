# BEACN Governance

This repository is the public-facing home for BEACN’s governance research outputs:

- Daily/weekly governance briefings
- Treasury withdrawal tracking (CIP-1694)
- Catalyst / grants tracking (work in progress)
- “Waste radar” (evidence-first flags + links to sources)

## Principles

- **Receipts-first:** every claim links to primary sources (anchors, official pages, tx hashes where available).
- **No keys:** never store secrets here.
- **Separation of roles:** this repo is research + reporting only; voting/signing happens elsewhere.

## Directory layout

- `reports/` — generated reports (markdown + CSV)
- `data/` — machine-readable snapshots (JSON/CSV) used by the viewer
- `site/` — static viewer (GitHub Pages-friendly)

## Status

Bootstrapped on 2026-02-09.
