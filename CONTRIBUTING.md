# Contributing

This is an open-source, receipts-first transparency project.

## What to contribute

- Missing receipts (deliverable links, reporting/closeout links, payment proof/tx hashes)
- Corrections to entity names (aliases)
- Improvements to parsing/flags that reduce false positives
- Additional canonical datasets (especially Project Catalyst payment/proposal snapshots)

## Ground rules

- Evidence-first. Critique spending with receipts.
- No harassment or targeted dogpiles.
- Avoid doxxing. Use publicly available identifiers only.

## How to propose a correction

Open an issue or PR with:
- link to the relevant snapshot entry (URL)
- the correction
- receipts (source links)
