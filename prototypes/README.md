# Prototypes

This folder contains prototype UI components and experiments that may be adapted into static pages for GitHub Pages.

- `treasury-intelligence.jsx` — original React/Recharts prototype that inspired `treasury-intelligence.html`.

Notes:
- The live site uses static HTML for reliability and verifiability.
- Prototypes should not be treated as canonical data sources.
