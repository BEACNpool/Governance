          "abstract": "Intersect's Parameter Committee proposes the first of two Parameter Update governance actions. The following change is proposed together in this rationale, but will require two separate, linked governance actions as per guardrail MTEU-M-04.\n\n1) increase Plutus script memory unit limits per transaction by 25% to allow greater flexibility for DApp developers.\n2) increase Plutus script memory unit limits per block by 25% to remain consistent with the current block memory limits.\n\nNo other protocol parameters or Plutus cost model setting will be changed.",
          "rationale": "Intersect's Parameter Committee proposes to update the Plutus memory unit limits (`maxTxExecutionUnits[memory]` and `maxBlockExecutionUnits[memory]`) to enable more work to be done by a Plutus script.\n\n## Technical Evaluation\n\nThe changes described in this governance action have been recommended by Intersect's Parameter Committee on [2025-05-08](https://forum.cardano.org/t/may-08-2025-parameter-committee-triweekly-meeting-notes/150392), and subsequently ratified by Intersect's Technical Steering Committee on 2025-10-01 (see via [Recording](https://youtu.be/Gd7t52uh3m0?si=FIHpflP8yxH-xWqi&t=1110) or [Minutes](https://committees.docs.intersectmbo.org/intersect-technical-steering-committee/meeting-minutes/2025-tsc-meeting-minutes/meeting-minutes-october-01-2025#decisions-actionshttps://committees.docs.intersectmbo.org/intersect-technical-steering-committee/meeting-minutes/2025-tsc-meeting-minutes/meeting-minutes-october-01-2025#decisions-actions)).\n\n### Testnet Deployments\n\nAn equivalent change was enacted on the Preview testnet within October 2025 `gov_action1d8y53n0fp34e6ltpt90g2dxpqmkygyevkpy6kf2c8xwmzfsvra5sq3c8rpt` and on the PreProd testnet within November 2025 `gov_action1zk80dvjfklp7cgvuvtg37zuwwe4r2erj6q3m67c7wdh0akth70rqq44samn`.\n\n### Functionality\n\nAs described below, the main effect of the update will be to enable more work to be done by Plutus scripts within a single block. This removes or reduces pain points for DApp developers and users.\n\n### Security\n\nNo specific security concerns are raised by this change. Performance results indicate that Praos timing guarantees will be maintained following this change.\n\n### Performance\n\nThere is no impact on overall performance or timing guarantees from increasing `maxTxExecutionUnits[memory]`. The impact on overall performance from increasing `maxBlockExecutionUnits[memory]` has been evaluated by IOE's Performance and Tracing team using node versions [10.2](https://updates.cardano.intersectmbo.org/reports/2025-03-execbudget-memory-10.2/) and [10.3](https://updates.cardano.intersectmbo.org/reports/2025-05-execbudget-memory-10.3/). These benchmarking results indicate that there is adequate headroom in critical timing metrics to allow the proposed increase.\n\n### Sustainability\n\nThe upgrade:\n\n1) reduces a pain point when building Plutus scripts (reducing the need for manual tweaking to meet per-transaction limits);\n\n2) allows more work to be done by an existing Plutus script;\n\n3) potentially allows more Plutus scripts to execute per block, if the work remains the same;\n\nThese upgrades ensure decentralized applications on Cardano can scale sustainably.\n\n## Plutus Memory Unit Changes\n\nPer-transaction and per-block Plutus memory unit limits will both be increased by the maximum recommended by the guardrails. This will ensure that the same number of maximally sized transactions (4) will fit into a single block.\n\n1) `maxTxExecutionUnits[memory]` will be increased from 14,000,000 memory units to 16,500,000 memory units (a ~17.9% increase);\n\n2) `maxBlockExecutionUnits[memory]` will be increased from 62,000,000 memory units to 72,000,000 memory units (a ~16.1% increase).\n\n### Impact of the Change to Memory Unit Limits\n\nThe Plutus memory unit settings serve to limit the total execution time that a Plutus script can take, as well as the memory usage. Measurements show that this is a more significant restriction on total Plutus execution time than `maxTxExecutionUnits[steps]` and `maxBlockExecutionUnits[steps]`. The limits have been increased historically, but were restricted by the need to adhere to Praos security guarantees. New benchmarking results following improvements to the Plutus interpreter and elsewhere indicate that there is now sufficient headroom to increase these limits.\n\n### Subsequent Changes\n\nThis governance action represents the first part of a proposed two-step increase of 25% to both `maxTxExecutionUnits[memory]` and `maxBlockExecutionUnits[memory]`. A subsequent governance action will propose to increase `maxTxExecutionUnits[memory]` to 17,500,000 units and `maxBlockExecutionUnits[memory]` to 77,500,000 units. To comply with the current guardrails, that governance action would need to be enacted no less than 2 epochs after the enactment of this governance action.\n\n## Consistency with Guardrails\n\nThe relevant guardrails in the [Cardano Constitution](https://cardano.org/constitution/) are:\n\n- **PARAM-03a**: Critical protocol parameters require an SPO vote in addition to a DRep vote: SPOs must say \"yes\" with a collective support of more than 50% of all active block production stake. This is enforced by the Guardrails on the stake pool voting threshold.\n\n- **PARAM-04a**: At least 3 months should normally pass between the publication of an off-chain proposal to change a critical protocol parameter and the submission of the corresponding on-chain governance action. This Guardrail may be relaxed in the event of a Severity 1 or Severity 2 network issue following careful technical discussion and evaluation.\n\n- **NETWORK-01**: No individual network parameter should change more than once per two epochs.\n\n- **NETWORK-02**: Only one network parameter should be changed per epoch unless they are directly correlated, e.g., per-transaction and per-block memory unit limits.\n\n- **MTEU-M-01**: `maxTxExecutionUnits[memory]` must not exceed 40,000,000 units\n\n- **MTEU-M-02**: `maxTxExecutionUnits[memory]` must not be negative\n\n- **MTEU-M-03**: `maxTxExecutionUnits[memory]` must not be decreased\n\n- **MTEU-M-04**: `maxTxExecutionUnits[memory]` should not be increased by more than 2,500,000 units in any epoch\n\n- **MBEU-M-01**: `maxBlockExecutionUnits[memory]` must not exceed 120,000,000 units\n\n- **MBEU-M-02**: `maxBlockExecutionUnits[memory]` must not be negative\n\n- **MBEU-M-03**: `maxBlockExecutionUnits[memory]` should not be changed (increased or decreased) by more than 10,000,000 units in any epoch\n\n- **MBEU-M-04a**: The impact of any change to maxBlockExecutionUnits[memory] must be confirmed by detailed benchmarking/simulation and not exceed the requirements of the block diffusion/propagation time budgets, as also impacted by `maxBlockExecutionUnits[steps]` and `maxBlockBodySize`. Any increase must also consider previously agreed future requirements for the total block size (`maxBlockBodySize`) measured against the total block diffusion target of 3s with 95% block propagation within 5s. Future Plutus performance improvements may allow the per-block memory limit to be increased, but must be balanced against the overall diffusion limits as specified in the previous sentence, and future requirements\n\n- **MEU-M-01**: `maxBlockExecutionUnits[memory]` must not be less than `maxTxExecutionUnits[memory]`\n\n- **PCM-01:** Cost model values must be set by benchmarking on a reference architecture\n\n- **PCM-02:** The cost model must be updated if new primitives are introduced or a new Plutus language version is added\n\n- **PCM-03:** Cost model values should not be negative\n\nThis governance action is consistent with all these guardrails. PARAM-03a, MTEU-M-01, MTEU-M-02, MBEU-M-01, and MBEU-M-02 can be checked by the automated guardrails script.\n\n### Consistency with PARAM-03a\n\n`maxBlockExecutionUnits[memory]` is a critical system parameter. The ledger rules require an SPO vote to change this setting; the corresponding SPO voting threshold then automatically enforces the voting requirement.\n\n### Consistency with PARAM-04a\n\n`maxBlockExecutionUnits[memory]` is a critical system parameter. It does not relate to a Severity 1 or Severity 2 network issue, so the guardrail cannot be relaxed. The [original proposal \"PCP003\"](https://forum.cardano.org/t/pcp-003-max-tx-ex-mem-pilanningham/125506/26) was [discussed](https://forum.cardano.org/c/governance/parameters-committee-updates/220) throughout the year in the open Parameter Committee Tri-Weekly and the intent to propose the change on-chain was specifically [published off-chain](https://forum.cardano.org/t/intention-to-changeplutus-script-memory-unit-limits-maxtxexecutionunits-memory-and-maxblockexecutionunits-memory/147270) on 2025-07-07 as per the guardrail's requirement of a 3 month notice period.\n\n### Consistency with NETWORK-01\n\nThe previous linked parameter update did not change either `maxTxExecutionUnits[memory]` or `maxBlockExecutionUnits[memory]`, and was enacted more than two epochs before this update would be enacted.\n\n### Consistency with NETWORK-02\n\n`maxTxExecutionUnits[memory]` and `maxBlockExecutionUnits[memory]` are related network parameters, and are explicitly identified as such in the guardrail.\n\n### Consistency with MTEU-M-01\n\nThe proposed setting of `maxTxExecutionUnits[memory]` is less than 40,000,000 units.\n\n### Consistency with MTEU-M-02\n\nThe proposed setting of `maxTxExecutionUnits[memory]` is positive.\n\n### Consistency with MTEU-M-03\n\nThe proposed setting of `maxTxExecutionUnits[memory]` is greater than the current setting of `maxTxExecutionUnits[memory]`.\n\n### Consistency with MTEU-M-04\n\nThe proposed setting of `maxTxExecutionUnits[memory]` represents an increase of 2,500,000 units, the maximum that is recommended by the guardrail.\n\n### Consistency with MBEU-M-01\n\nThe proposed setting of `maxBlockExecutionUnits[memory]` is less than 120,000,000 units.\n\n### Consistency with MBEU-M-02\n\nThe proposed setting of `maxBlockExecutionUnits[memory]` is positive.\n\n### Consistency with MBEU-M-03\n\nThe proposed setting of `maxBlockExecutionUnits[memory]` represents an increase of 10,000,000 units, the maximum that is recommended by the guardrail.\n\n### Consistency with MBEU-M-04a\n\nBenchmarking confirms that the performance should be within the stated bounds, and that there is scope for further increases.\n\n### Consistency with MEU-M-01\n\nThe per-block limit (`maxBlockExecutionUnits[memory]`) is significantly greater than the per-transaction limit (`maxTxExecutionUnits[memory]`).\n\n## Reversion Plan\n\nThis change has minimal or no effect on overall network performance, so it is unlikely to need to be reverted. The change to `maxTxExecutionUnits[memory]` could be reverted, if necessary, to its current setting. However, the change can only sensibly be reversed if no transactions or scripts have taken advantage of it: reverting `maxTxExecutionUnits[memory]` to its present setting would cause disruption to any DApp developers and users that have exploited it, requiring them to rewrite or reconfigure their Plutus scripts. Reverting this setting without also reverting `maxBlockExecutionUnits[memory]` would increase the number of full-sized Plutus script transactions that could be processed in a single block. This is unlikely to be harmful.\n\nThe change to `maxBlockExecutionUnits[memory]` could be reverted to its current setting if network performance showed an unexpectedly negative impact. Reverting it without also reverting `maxTxExecutionUnits[memory]` could, however, reduce the number of full-sized Plutus script transactions that could be processed in a single block.",
          "motivation": "Community members have expressed a desire to increase the Plutus script memory unit limits to simplify DApp development and enhance scalability - see [PCP-003](https://forum.cardano.org/t/pcp-003-max-tx-ex-mem-pilanningham/125506) and [public survey results](https://cardanocommunity.typeform.com/report/rjRd2Fn0/UYLpnsukGSDRPJ4r).\n\nRaising `maxTxExecutionUnits[memory]` and `maxBlockExecutionUnits[memory]` could significantly improve Plutus script throughput with minimal impact on block propagation or node performance, making it a low-risk and high-impact change.",

          "rationale": "Max was a much-loved member of the Cardano community, always thoughtful, generous, sharp-minded, and deeply committed to those he worked alongside.\n\nHe made significant contributions to the development of Cardano\u2019s constitution and to many of the governance discussions and optimizations that will help shape the network\u2019s future.\n\nMax was integral to the election of the first fully elected Constitutional Committee (CC), serving as both a member and co-lead of the Constitutional Committee Election Working Group.\n\nHis impact on the network's founding governance documents was profound; as a delegate representing the Dutch Cardano community at the Constitutional Convention in Buenos Aires, he was one of the primary driving forces behind the inclusion of Article VIII in the Constitution.\n\nMax was a dedicated DRep as a vital part of the Dutch DRep Collective, ensuring the voices of his community were heard. He was also a creative technologist, founding AdaMoments, a project that enabled ada holders to preserve their personal history by storing images, videos, and text as permanent \"moments\" on the Cardano blockchain. Beyond his own initiatives, Max was deeply committed to the Dutch community, facilitating meetups and connecting people across the ecosystem.\n\nMax\u2019s legacy lives on through the frameworks he helped build and the moments he helped archive.",
          "motivation": "There is a tradition of naming hard forks in memory of notable historical figures or significant contributors to the Cardano community.\n\nIt started with Byron and continued up until today with Shelley, Allegra, Mary, Alonzo, Vasil, Valentine, Chang and Plomin, with Vasil, Chang and Plomin named after honoured community members who recently passed away.\n\nNaming this hard fork in memory of Max van Rossem would continue the tradition of weaving lasting memories of impactful contributors to the Cardano blockchain ecosystem for their families and ecosystem as a whole.",

          "abstract": "The Cardano Constitution requires the establishment of a Net Change Limit (NCL), which defines the maximum amount of lovelace that can be withdrawn from the treasury during an outlined period of time. This governance action serves as an opportunity for all governance stakeholders to formally express their positions regarding the proposed Net Change Limit, ensuring transparency, accountability, and alignment across the ecosystem.\n\nThe Net Change Limit will begin at the start of **Epoch 613** (13 February 2026) and conclude at the end of **Epoch 713** (3 July 2027). The Net Change Limit will be **350,000,000,000,000 lovelace** (350M ada). Unless superseded by a new NCL, this is the maximum amount that can be withdrawn from the treasury during this specific period and shall not be exceeded.\n\nThe Net Change Limit will be used when reviewing treasury withdrawal actions to ensure constitutionality as required by Article IV of the Cardano Constitution and the Treasury Withdrawal Guardrails outlined in Appendix I.\n\nThis action has been submitted on the behalf of the Cardano Budget Committee at Intersect, following community feedback.",
          "rationale": "### Period and Amount\n\nThe Net Change Limit (NCL) shall begin at the start of **Epoch 613** (13 February 2026) and conclude at the end of **Epoch 713** (3 July 2027).\n\nThe Net Change Limit shall be set at **350,000,000,000,000 lovelace** (350 million ada).\n\nAn approximately **16-month 20 day NCL period** is proposed to realign the NCL cycle with the mid-year budget season rather than year-end holidays, aiming to improve governance participation and downstream ecosystem impact. This timing also ensures that, when setting the subsequent NCL, a fully completed prior year of treasury inflow data is available, enabling more accurate modeling and clearer justification.\n\n### Calculation and Methodology\n\nNet Income for 2025 is defined as the sum of treasury inflows from **Epoch 532** through **Epoch 604**. These inflows totaled **306,940,195 ada**.\n\nTo recognize existing approved budgets, the withdrawal limit is set at **350 million ada**, representing approximately **115%** of the realized Net Income. This elevated cap was primarily driven by the inclusion of the 2025 Stablecoin DeFi Liquidity Budget (Gov Action ID: gov_action1u4jrcvlkppjzuv5j9z5ksacwtvv77h6glu0knpcjut8gvjjfu0cqqt3alsy).\n\nAlthough DReps approved this **50 million ada** allocation, the proposers have not requested the funds via a treasury withdrawal/s at time of this NCL submission. However, to respect the will of the DReps and their demonstrated willingness to fund this initiative in 2025, we deemed it responsible to incorporate this approved amount into our NCL projection. Consequently, the current financial projection reflects both the inclusion of this 2025 budget and an evaluation of the anticipated development load for 2026.\n\n### Application and Compliance\n\nThis limit shall be applied in assessing **treasury withdrawal actions** to ensure compliance with Article IV of the Cardano Constitution and the Treasury Withdrawal Guardrails specified in Appendix I.\n\n### Voting and Thresholds\n\nA vote in favor of this proposal indicates agreement with the proposed Net Change Limit, allowing for the submission of treasury withdrawal governance actions. However, the maximum amount that can be withdrawn from the treasury during this specific period shall not exceed the total sum outlined herein.\n\nPer the Cardano Constitution, the approval of a Net Change Limit requires a threshold of **greater than 50%** of the active voting DRep stake. Therefore, this Net Change Limit will be considered passed if, at the time the governance action expires, the DRep **YES** votes represent **more than 50%** of the active voting stake. While not obligated, Constitutional Committee members are encouraged to provide their opinion via a rationale on this Net Change Limit.",
          "motivation": "Prior to the submission of any treasury withdrawal, a Net Change Limit must be formally agreed upon by delegated representatives (Article IV Section 3 of the Constitution). Failure to establish a Net Change Limit shall render any such treasury withdrawal action unconstitutional and, therefore, inapplicable.\n\nThe Net Change Limit will be effective for the period specified in this action.",

          "abstract": "This Budget Info Action asks DReps and the Cardano community to signal support for a **\u20b31,500,000, 6-month budget** to harden and scale **DeltaDeFi**, a Hydra-based, low-latency order-book exchange aiming to become core **trading infrastructure for Cardano**, focused on ADA and Cardano native tokens (CNTs).\n\nThe requested budget is intended to:\n\n* Bring the current **Hydra spot DEX** from beta to a production-ready venue for both API traders and everyday users;\n* Scale the **Hydra and data infrastructure** so Cardano has at least one CEX-grade venue for ADA and key CNT pairs; and\n* Deliver a **Vision 2030 KPI Measurement Programme** (baseline report + live dashboard + progress report) that tracks DeFi infrastructure contribution to ecosystem goals.\n\nWithin the \u20b31,500,000 total:\n\n* 80% is dedicated to engineering, operations and security for the Hydra trading infrastructure; and\n* 20% is dedicated to the **Vision 2030 KPI Measurement Programme**:\n  * an initial **\"State of Cardano DeFi\" baseline report**,\n  * a public **Vision 2030 KPI dashboard**, and\n  * a final **6-month progress report**",
          "rationale": "## 6-Month Roadmap and Scope\n\nOver the 6-month budget period, the work is grouped into three tightly scoped tracks.\n\n### 1. Hardening the Hydra spot DEX\n\n**Goal:** move the existing beta mainnet exchange to a **production-grade trading venue**.\n\nKey activities:\n\n* Improve **matching engine robustness**, latency and failure-mode handling on Hydra;\n* Strengthen **risk controls, monitoring and incident response** for production use;\n* Complete **security reviews and targeted audits** of critical components (on-chain scripts, Hydra integration);\n* Improve **API stability, documentation and sandbox environments** so professional traders and bots can integrate with confidence; and\n* Deliver and maintain a **public status page** for uptime and incident reporting.\n\n**Outcome:** Cardano has a live, hardened Hydra spot DEX that can realistically serve as a primary venue for order-book trading in ADA and key CNT pairs.\n\n### 2. Scaling infrastructure and integrations\n\n**Goal:** ensure DeltaDeFi is **usable and visible as infrastructure**, not only as a stand-alone app.\n\nKey activities:\n\n* Scale **Hydra and indexing infrastructure** to handle growing order and volume loads;\n* Improve **wallet and protocol integrations**, making it easy for users and other Cardano dApps to use DeltaDeFi as a liquidity source;\n* Extend markets to include other pairs, and selected CNT pairs where depth and tight spreads matter; and\n* Design the platform so that **AI-driven liquidity agents and automated trading systems** can integrate via APIs in future roadmap phases, without adding complexity to this budget period.\n\n**Outcome:** DeltaDeFi functions as a **reliable, API-friendly trading venue** that Cardano projects, CNT issuers and larger participants can build on.\n\n### 3. Vision 2030 KPI Measurement Programme\n\n**Goal:** make DeltaDeFi's contribution to **Vision 2030 goals** measurable and tie the benefit of this budget to ecosystem-wide KPIs.\n\nThis track is detailed below. **20% of the total budget** is explicitly reserved for its delivery and is payable at the end of the 6-month period.\n\n## Vision 2030 KPI Measurement Programme\n\nTo make the impact of this budget visible against **Cardano Vision 2030 goals**, DeltaDeFi will deliver:\n\n1. An **initial baseline report** measuring current DeFi KPIs;\n2. A **public Vision 2030 KPI dashboard**; and\n3. A **final 6-month report** assessing progress toward Vision 2030 targets.\n\n### 1. Initial \"State of Cardano DeFi\" report (baseline)\n\nEarly in the budget period, DeltaDeFi will publish a baseline measuring Cardano's current position against **Vision 2030 DeFi vertical goals** (\"institutional-grade liquidity and usable Cardano-native DeFi\").\n\n**Scope:** ADA/USDM pair across **top 3 Cardano DEXs**, benchmarked against **top 3 ADA CEXs**.\n\n| Vision 2030 KPI Area | Baseline Metrics |\n| :---: | :---: |\n| **DeFi Vertical** | Slippage, spread, depth for 1k/10k/100k ADA; CEX price gap |\n| **Adoption (TVL)** | Current DeFi TVL across measured venues |\n| **Adoption (MAU)** | Active trading addresses |\n\n**CNT Market Quality:** Price discrepancies for major CNTs across DEXs vs CEX benchmarks.\n\n**Suggested Targets:** The report will propose **governance-grade targets** aligned with Vision 2030:\n\n* Target slippage/cost ranges for \"institutional-grade\" execution;\n* Desired spread and depth levels; and\n* CNT price alignment expectations.\n\nWhere data access is limited, limitations will be documented.\n\n### 2. Public Vision 2030 KPI Dashboard\n\nDeltaDeFi will build and maintain a **public dashboard** structured around the **Cardano Vision 2030 KPIs**, making DeFi infrastructure contribution to ecosystem goals measurable and transparent.\n\n#### Adoption KPIs (Vision 2030: TVL $3B, MAU 1M, Transactions \u226527M/month)\n\n| Metric | Scope |  Description |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| **Total Value Locked** | DeltaDeFi | Locked value in DeltaDeFi contracts |\n| **Monthly Active Users** | DeltaDeFi + Cross-DEX | Unique trading addresses with historical trends |\n| **Trading Volume** | DeltaDeFi + Cross-DEX | Daily/monthly matched order volume |\n| **Transaction Count** | DeltaDeFi | Contribution to Cardano transaction throughput |\n\n#### DeFi Vertical KPIs (Vision 2030: \"Institutional-grade liquidity and usable DeFi\")\n\n| Metric | Scope | Description |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| **Slippage (1k/10k/100k ADA)** | Top 3 DEXs + DeltaDeFi  | Execution cost at standard trade sizes |\n| **Depth within \u00b11%** | Top 3 DEXs + DeltaDeFi | Available liquidity near mid-price |\n| **CEX Price Gap** | Cross-DEX vs Top 3 CEXs | Deviation from CEX reference mid |\n| **Bid-Ask Spread** | DeltaDeFi | Average spread for ADA/USDM |\n\n#### Scalability KPIs (Vision 2030: L2 Integration, 3x Throughput)\n\n| Metric | Scope | Description |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| **L1 Settlement Transactions** | DeltaDeFi | L1 txs attributable to DeltaDeFi Hydra activity |\n| **L1 Fees Generated** | DeltaDeFi | Protocol revenue contribution from settlements |\n| **L2 Transaction Ratio** | DeltaDeFi | Hydra txs vs L1 settlements (scaling efficiency) |\n\n#### Dashboard Features\n\n* **Baseline comparison toggle**: Compare current metrics against initial report\n* **Historical trends**: Track KPI progress over the 6-month period\n\n### 3. Final 6-month Vision 2030 Progress Report\n\nAt the end of the 6-month period, DeltaDeFi will publish a **Vision 2030 progress report** assessing DeFi infrastructure advancement:\n\n| Assessment Area | Comparison |\n| :---: | :---: |\n| **DeFi Vertical KPIs** | Baseline vs current slippage, spread, depth, CEX gap |\n| **Adoption KPIs** | TVL and MAU growth over period |\n| **Scalability KPIs** | L1 footprint and L2 transaction efficiency           |\n| **Suggested Targets**  | Actual vs proposed targets from baseline             |\n\nThe report will comment on:\n\n* Progress toward Vision 2030 DeFi vertical goals;\n* Remaining gaps and recommended next steps; and\n* Lessons for future Treasury-funded DeFi infrastructure.\n\nThe budget reserved for this programme (baseline report, dashboard and final report) is **payable at the end of the 6-month period** upon delivery and DAC sign-off.\n\n## Fund Release Schedule\n\nFunds will be released in three phases over the 6-month project duration:\n\n| Phase | Amount | % of Total | Release Date | Cumulative |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| Phase 1 | \u20b3560,000 | 37.3% | Project Start | \u20b3560,000 |\n| Phase 2 | \u20b3560,000 | 37.3% | End of Month 3 | \u20b31,120,000 |\n| Phase 3 | \u20b3380,000 | 25.3% | End of Month 6 | \u20b31,500,000 |\n\n### Release Approval Mechanism\n\nFund releases are governed by the **DeltaDeFi Administration Committee (DAC)** as defined in the Administration section below.\n\n### Safeguard: Fund Return Policy\n\nIf the DAC multisig (4-of-6) votes to stop the project:\n\n1. The project will be immediately suspended.\n2. All remaining funds will be returned to the Cardano Treasury.\n3. A public report detailing the reason for suspension will be published within 14 days.\n\nAny unused funds from completed phases will also be returned to the Treasury at project conclusion.\n\n## Budget and Administration\n\n**Total budget:** \u20b31,500,000 over 6 months. Breakdown:\n\n* **\u20b31,120,000 \u2013 Hydra trading infrastructure**\n  * Core engineering for the matching engine, API, Hydra integration and indexers;\n  * Operations, infra and security (hosting, monitoring, incident response);\n  * Wallet and protocol integrations and production support.\n* **\u20b3280,000 \u2013 Vision 2030 KPI Measurement Programme**\n  * Initial \"State of Cardano DeFi\" baseline report;\n  * Public Vision 2030 KPI dashboard implementation and maintenance;\n  * Final 6-month Vision 2030 progress report.\n* **\u20b3100,000 \u2013 Administration and independent audit**\n  * Administration multisig operations (transaction fees, bookkeeping, reporting);\n  * **Independent financial and technical audits** of funded work and spending;\n  * Preparation and publication of audit summaries for the community.\n\n### Administration committee and multisig\n\nA future **Treasury Withdrawal GA** based on this Info Action will specify a **DeltaDeFi Administration Committee (DAC)** as the administrator for the budget. The intended DAC composition is as below:\n\nDeltaDeFi representatives:\n\n* **Hinson Wong** (Co-founder of DeltaDeFi)\n* **Anson Chui** (Co-founder of DeltaDeFi)\n\nEcosystem representatives:\n\n* **Mike Hornan** (Cardano Ambassador / Governance Educator)\n* **James Meidinger** (CEO, Freeblocks LLC / BizDev, USDM Moneta non-representative capacity)\n* **Hosky** (ecosystem representative)\n* **Shigeki Tabira** (ecosystem representative, SIPO SPO / DRep)\n\nAll Treasury-related funds and assets for this budget will be held under a **4-out-of-6 multisig** controlled by the DAC. Any movement of ADA from the administration addresses (for example, milestone disbursements, payment of audit costs) will require at least **four affirmative signatures out of six**.\n\nThe Withdrawal GA will also specify that:\n\n* Funds are held in **segregated, publicly auditable addresses**, separate from other project funds or personal wallets;\n* These addresses are **delegated to the auto-abstain option and never to SPOs**, in line with the Constitution; and\n* Funds will be released according to the **Fund Release Schedule** above:\n  * **Phase 1 (\u20b3560,000)** and **Phase 2 (\u20b3560,000)** cover the \u20b31,120,000 infrastructure development budget;\n  * **Phase 3 (\u20b3380,000)** covers the \u20b3280,000 Vision 2030 KPI Measurement Programme and \u20b3100,000 administration/audit costs, payable upon end-of-period delivery and DAC multisig sign-off.\n\n### Independent audit and review\n\n* Part of the **\u20b3100,000 administration and audit budget** will fund an **independent auditor**, in line with the Cardano Constitution\u2019s auditor requirement for Treasury-funded work.\n* The Treasury Withdrawal GA will specify the auditor\u2019s role, scope and reporting cadence, and audit results will be summarised publicly so the community can verify how funds were used.\n\n# Alignment with Cardano Vision 2030\n\nThis proposal supports multiple pillars of the **Cardano Vision 2030** strategic framework.\n\n## Strategic Alignment\n\n| Vision 2030 Priority | DeltaDeFi Contribution |\n| :---: | :---: |\n| **Pillar 1: L2 Integration** \u2013 \"High-frequency, low-latency transactions with L1 security\" | Production-grade Hydra trading venue proving L2 works for DeFi |\n| **Pillar 2: DeFi Vertical** \u2013 \"Institutional-grade liquidity and usable Cardano-native DeFi\" | Order-book infrastructure for professional traders and market makers |\n| **L2 \u2192 L1 Value Retention** \u2013 \"Layer 2 solutions contribute value back to the L1 protocol\" | Settlement fees from Hydra activity flow back to L1 |\n| **Scalability** \u2013 \"3x current throughput capacity\" | Validates L2 scaling approach for high-volume use cases |\n\n## KPIs for This Proposal\n\n### Ecosystem Impact\n\n| KPI | 6-Month Target | Measurement |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| **DeltaDeFi TVL** | \u2265$10M | On-chain locked value |\n| **Monthly Trading Volume** | \u2265$30M | Matched order volume |\n| **Active Traders (MAU)** | \u22651,000 unique traders | Unique trading addresses |\n| **L1 Settlement Transactions** | \u22655,000 txs/month | L1 txs from DeltaDeFi |\n| **L2 Transactions** | 1M/month | Scaling efficiency |\n\n### Market Quality (per dashboard and reports)\n\n| KPI | Target | Measurement |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| **ADA/USDM Slippage (10k ADA)** | \u22640.3% | Simulated execution cost |\n| **Bid-Ask Spread** | \u22640.5% | Average spread |\n| **Price Gap vs CEX** | \u22641% deviation | Deviation from CEX mid |\n| **Depth within \u00b11%** | \u2265$100k equivalent liquidity | Near-mid liquidity |\n\n### Operational\n\n| KPI | Target |\n| :---: | :---: |\n| **Platform Uptime** | Public status page with incident reporting |\n| **API Availability** | Documented uptime metrics and post-mortems |\n| **Baseline Report** | Month 1-2 |\n| **Dashboard Live** | Month 2-3 |\n| **Final Report** | Month 6 |\n\n## Contribution to Vision 2030 KPIs\n\nVision 2030 defines 9 core KPIs. DeltaDeFi directly contributes to 5 of them:\n\n| Vision 2030 KPI | Current | 2030 Target | DeltaDeFi 6-Mo Target | Contribution |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| **TVL** | $200M | $3B | $10M | 0.33% |\n| **MAU** | 100-300k | 1M | 1,000 traders | 0.10% |\n| **Monthly Transactions** | 800k | 27M | 5,000 L1 settlements | 0.02% (L1) |\n| **Protocol Revenue** | 3.5M ADA | \u226516M ADA | ~10k ADA/yr | 0.06% |\n| **Throughput Capacity** | 300k/day | 3x current | 1M L2 tx/month | **5.56%** |\n\n**KPIs Not Addressed:** Uptime (99.98%), Voting Power Distribution, Alternative Node Clients, DRep Participation.\n\n### Throughput Contribution Analysis\n\nThe **Throughput Capacity** KPI is DeltaDeFi's strongest contribution. Based on Cardano's L1 theoretical maximum of 46.7M tx/month ([Chainspect](https://chainspect.app/chain/cardano): 18.02 TPS), the 3x target requires closing an 18M tx/month gap. DeltaDeFi's 1M L2 transactions per month represents **5.56%** of this gap via L2 scaling.\n\nThis aligns with Vision 2030's L2 integration strategy: \"high-volume activity can move off L1 and settle back.\" DeltaDeFi demonstrates a **200:1 L2-to-L1 efficiency ratio** (1M L2 transactions settled via 5,000 L1 transactions).\n\n### Budget Efficiency vs KPI Contribution\n\n| Metric | Value |\n| :---: | :---: |\n| Budget Requested | \u20b31.5M |\n| Estimated 5-Year Treasury | \u20b31,000M (200M NCL \u00d7 5) |\n| **Budget Utilization** | **0.15%** |\n\n**Weighted KPI Contribution** (equal weight across 9 KPIs):\n\n| KPI | Contribution | Weight (1/9) | Weighted |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| TVL | 0.33% | 11.1% | 0.037% |\n| MAU | 0.10% | 11.1% | 0.011% |\n| Monthly Txs | 0.02% | 11.1% | 0.002% |\n| Protocol Revenue | 0.06% | 11.1% | 0.007% |\n| Throughput | 5.56% | 11.1% | 0.618% |\n| 4 KPIs (not addressed) | 0% | 44.4% | 0% |\n| **Total** |   |   | **0.68%** |\n\n| Input | Output | Efficiency |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| 0.15% of treasury | 0.68% weighted KPI contribution | **4.5x ROI** |\n\n# Constitutionality Checklist (Info Action scope)\n\n* **Purpose**\n  * This proposal is for work intended to enhance the **liquidity, usability and long-term sustainability** of Cardano by providing Hydra-based trading infrastructure and transparent trading-quality metrics. It fits within **Article IV.1** as a budget for the future development of the ecosystem.\n* **Article III.5 \u2013 On-chain governance process**\n  * The proposal will be submitted in a clear, standard format with:\n  * Title, abstract, motivation and rationale; and\n  * A URL and content hash for this off-chain document.\n* **Info Action nature**\n  * This is a **Budget Info Action**, not a Treasury Withdrawal:\n  * It **does not move any ADA** from the Treasury; and\n  * It records DRep and community sentiment on whether a **\u20b31,500,000, 6-month budget** for DeltaDeFi Hydra trading infrastructure and market-quality metrics is desirable in principle.\n* **Article IV \u2013 Budgets and Treasury Withdrawals (future work)**\n  * Any subsequent Treasury Withdrawal GA based on this Info Action will:\n  * Respect the **Net Change Limit (NCL)** in effect at the time (amount and timing);\n  * Specify an administrator and administration model in line with **Article IV.2**;\n  * Make explicit provision for **an independent auditor and audit process** in line with Article IV.4 (including dedicated budget and reporting expectations).\n  * Ensure funds are held in **segregated, auto-abstain-delegated addresses** while under administration.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThis Budget Info Action asks whether the Cardano community supports dedicating **\u20b31,500,000 over 6 months** to:\n\n* Harden and scale **DeltaDeFi** into a production-grade Hydra trading venue for ADA and key CNT pairs; and\n* Deliver a **Vision 2030 KPI Measurement Programme** with baseline report, public dashboard, and progress report tracking DeFi infrastructure contribution to ecosystem goals.\n\nThe intent is not to fund a niche application, but to strengthen **Cardano's core trading infrastructure** in alignment with **Vision 2030's DeFi vertical** (\"institutional-grade liquidity and usable DeFi\") and provide measurable data on progress toward ecosystem KPIs.\n\nVoters are not yet asked to approve any withdrawals. They are asked to signal whether this direction \u2014 **supporting Hydra-based trading infrastructure and Vision 2030-aligned KPI measurement** \u2014 is a good use of Treasury budgeting for the next 6 months.",
          "motivation": "## Why this matters for Cardano, ADA and CNT holders\n\nCardano currently lacks a **low-latency order-book venue** that can:\n\n* Support **API-driven trading, arbitrage and market-making** at scale;\n* Offer **tight spreads and low slippage** in key ADA\u2013stable and ADA\u2013CNT markets; and\n* Provide a clear, measurable picture of how competitive Cardano is as an L1 for trading compared with other ecosystems and CEXs.\n\nToday, most Cardano trading happens on AMM-style DEXs. They are great for simple swaps, but they are not optimised for:\n\n* **Low-fee, low-slippage execution at size** in core ADA and CNT pairs;\n* **Instant, predictable fills** for API and bot-driven strategies; or\n* **Professional market-makers and arbitrageurs** who expect CEX-like order-book behaviour.\n\nDeltaDeFi is designed to fill this gap: a **Hydra-based, low-latency order-book** with **tight spreads, fast matching** and **first-class API support**, so that ADA and CNT liquidity can be deployed efficiently and Cardano can compete more directly with order-book venues on other chains and on CEXs.\n\nA performant, observable exchange is therefore not just another dApp, but part of Cardano\u2019s **core infrastructure**. It supports the Constitution\u2019s emphasis on **future development of the ecosystem** by making Cardano a more attractive base layer for capital, traders, and applications built around ADA and CNTs.\n\n## Why Hydra and why DeltaDeFi\n\nHydra offers the latency and UX profile needed for modern trading but is still under-represented in production-grade, user-facing protocols. DeltaDeFi is:\n\n* A **Hydra-based, low-latency order-book DEX** already live in beta on mainnet;\n* Built by a team with an existing track record in:\n  * high-frequency trading tooling,\n  * Cardano SDKs and infrastructure, and\n  * Project Catalyst delivery; and\n* Focused on **spot trading and API-driven participants**, where reliable execution and transparent metrics matter most.\n\nEarlier Project Catalyst funding helped bootstrap the current codebase and beta deployment with relatively modest budgets. This proposal is intended to take that work from \"working beta\" to **robust, measurable infrastructure** for the whole ecosystem.\n\n## Team Background\n\nDeltaDeFi is built by the same team behind **SIDAN Lab**, with a multi-year track record in the Cardano ecosystem:\n\n* **MeshJS Core Maintainers**: The team maintains [MeshJS](https://meshjs.dev), the largest TypeScript SDK in the Cardano ecosystem, used by numerous dApps and developers for wallet integration, transaction building, and smart contract interaction.\n* **Stake Pool Operators & DReps**: Single SPO (SIDAN) since 2021 and an active DRep in Cardano governance.\n* **Cardano Hong Kong Community**: Active contributors to the Cardano HK community, organizing meetups, workshops, and developer education initiatives.\n* **Open Source Commitment**: Consistent delivery of open-source tooling and infrastructure, with MeshJS serving as critical developer infrastructure across the ecosystem.\n* **Extensive open source footprint** - 47 public repositories on [GitHub](https://github.com/sidan-lab) including multi-language Cardano SDKs: Whisky (Rust), Vodka (Aiken), Rum (Go), and Gin (Python), all Apache-2.0 licensed\n* **Project Catalyst Track Record**: Multiple successfully delivered Catalyst projects spanning SDK development, developer tooling, and infrastructure.\n\nThis background in developer tooling and infrastructure directly informs DeltaDeFi's approach: building robust, well-documented, API-first trading infrastructure that other projects can integrate with.\n\n## Direct relevance to ADA and CNT holders\n\nFrom the point of view of ADA and CNT holders, the key questions are:\n\n* **How expensive is it to move size on Cardano?**\n  Slippage plus fees for 1k / 10k / 100k ADA trades in core pairs such as ADA/USDM.\n\n* **How well aligned are ADA and major CNT prices across DEXs and with CEX prices?**\n  Price gaps between on-chain venues and a simple CEX reference.\n\n* **How fragmented and inconsistent are CNT markets across Cardano DEXs?**\n  Differences in price, depth and execution quality for the same tokens on different venues.\n\nToday, answering these questions requires stitching together multiple tools and APIs. As part of this budget, DeltaDeFi will:\n\n* Deliver **tighter, deeper markets** on at least one Hydra-based venue; and\n* Publish a **Vision 2030 KPI dashboard** so ADA and CNT holders can track, in numbers, whether Cardano is progressing toward its DeFi vertical goals.",

          "rationale": "# I. Summary of Changes and Rationale (v1.0 \u2192 v2.4)\n\n## 1. Items Removed from the Constitution (v1.0)\n\n### (a) Expectations and Encouragement clauses\n\nExpectations: ARTICLE III. Section 6 (off-chain governance management), ARTICLE V. Section 3 (DRep code of conduct), ARTICLE V. Section 4 (DRep selection tool), ARTICLE VII. Section 1 (CC expertise), ARTICLE VII. Section 7 (CC tool support)\n\nEncouragement: ARTICLE VI. Section 3 (SPO code of conduct), ARTICLE VIII. Section 1 (constitutional discussion)\n\nRationale: These provisions were aspirational or advisory in nature (expectations/encouragements), not enforceable constitutional rules.\n\n### (b) Budget Info Action Provisions (ARTICLE III. Section 4, ARTICLE IV, ARTICLE VII. Section 4)\n\nRationale: The Budget Info Action mechanism was removed to simplify governance. Its requirements have been absorbed into Treasury Withdrawal Governance Actions.\n\n### \\(c\\) Obligation to Create a CC Code of Conduct (ARTICLE VII. Section 6)\n\nRationale: This was considered an operational detail better left to community practice rather than a constitutional mandate. The CC may still adopt codes of conduct, but it is no longer a constitutional requirement.\n\n## 2. Changes and additions (excluding deletions)\n\n### (a) Overall - Fixed typos, simplified wording, and unified terminology.\n\nRationale: Improves readability and ensures consistency\n\n### (b) Defined Terms: - Added definitions such as Active Voting Stake,  DRep, SPO, Net Change Limit, Treasury Withdrawal Recipient.\n\nRationale: Eliminates ambiguity and ensures consistency in interpretation\n\n### \\(c\\) ARTICLE II, Section 6 \u2013 Introduced requirement that \u201cThe document hosted by such a URL shall be immutable.\u201d\n\nRationale: Ensure proposals cannot be altered after submission, protecting integrity and trust\n\n### (d) ARTICLE II Section 7 :Reassigned conditions previously tied to the Budget Info Action, making them mandatory at the time of Treasury Withdrawals after its removal\n\nRationale: Strengthen accountability and transparency in the use of Treasury funds and preserve oversight and audit safeguards after removing the Budget Info Action mechanism\n\n# II. Summary of Changes and Rationale (v2.3 \u2192 v2.4)\n\nEMURGO expressed concerns regarding three specific wording changes introduced in Constitution v2.3 and voted NO on its adoption.\nSince EMURGO is the largest DRep, and changing the Constitution without its consent would be highly impractical, these three modifications are reverted to the wording used in the original Constitution (v1.0).\n\n1. Change \"Ada Holder\" to \"ada owner\" and remove this definition.\n\n2. Revert the wording of provisions related to custodians to the form used in v1.0.\n\n3. Revert the wording of provisions related to independent audits to the form used in v1.0.",
          "motivation": "# The proposed changes aim to:\n1. Simplify governance by removing non-binding expectations and redundant mechanisms like Budget Info Action.\n2. Improve clarity and consistency through unified terminology, added definitions, and streamlined provisions.\n3. Strengthen accountability by applying treasury audit safeguards universally and ensuring proposal documents remain immutable.\n\nPlease see the \"Rationale\" section for details.",

During the first part of 2025 this process also received delegated authority and funding by Cardano DReps during the 2025 budget cycle.\n\nThe extensive process the Product Committee followed, which **involved 700+ people**, focused on collecting as much input as possible from the broader community with attention to representative groups via different channels such as surveys, focus groups and remote and in-person workshops, and then reconnecting with those same groups to review a draft proposal based on the input provided.

          "rationale": "To make the first community-led process to define Cardano\u2019s vision for 2030 and a Strategy to get there, the Product Committee followed an extensive repeatable open process, and got further legitimacy by the delegated authority the approved budget gave.\n\nNow that we are in full governance and the Cardano community is fully leading Cardano we aim to share a common direction to channel our common effort. The proposed vision and Strategy are aiming to offer that.\n\nAll the elements of this proposal, Vision, Mission, Strategy framework and KPIs, are not intended to remain fixed forever, but rather be **a starting point** to constantly review as new data become available and improve to remain relevant. The process followed to reach this point is documented and repeatable, but any other comparable process supported by data and community consultation will provide a strong foundation for future updates via info actions.\n\n### Vision Breakdown\n\n*Cardano is the most secure, reliable and censorship-resistant blockchain for mission critical applications to power economies and societies of the future.*\n\n\u201c*Most secure, reliable and censorship-resistant*\u201d refers to the current qualities Cardano has achieved through its infrastructure, 99% uptime and decentralized structure.  \n\u201c*For mission critical applications*\u201d refers to those applications (AKA potential clients) that would require \u201c*secure, reliable and censorship-resistant*\u201d infrastructure for their use cases. \u201c*To power economies and societies of the future*\u201d refers to the broader goal these applications (clients) have.\n\n### Mission Breakdown\n\n*To empower a global ecosystem of builders, businesses, organizations, governments and communities by providing a scalable, secure, and research-based platform that enables the creation of transparent and fair digital economies.*\n\n*\u201cTo empower a global ecosystem of builders, businesses, organizations, governments and communities\u201d*  refers to the foundational layer we provide and who are the key groups that we see will benefit from it*. \u201cby providing a scalable, secure, and research-based platform that enables the creation of transparent and fair digital economies.\u201d* connects to the offering covered in the vision.\n\n### Strategy Framework overview\n\nRead the full Strategy Framework [here](https://product.cardano.intersectmbo.org/vision/strategy-2030)\n\n* **Pillar 1**: Infrastructure & Research Excellence  \n  Keep Cardano secure, fast, and interoperable so it can host more economic activity.  \n* **Pillar 2**: Adoption & Utility  \n  Driving widespread, non-speculative utility by focusing on high-value industry verticals, superior user experience (UX), and enterprise-grade security.  \n* **Pillar 3**: Governance  \n  Cardano governance must be hard to capture, easy to use, and paced. This builds directly on Cardano\u2019s tripartite model of DReps, Constitutional Committee, and SPOs.  \n* **Pillar 4**: Community & Ecosystem Growth  \n  Driving global engagement through a market-centric approach, cultivating a skilled developer base, and proactively demonstrating ecosystem value.  \n* **Pillar 5**: Ecosystem Sustainability & Resilience  \n  Ensuring the long-term financial health and operational integrity of the network infrastructure.\n\nThe **current proposed KPIs** aim to cover the minimum high level required to both track progress and to show ecosystem status externally. As the Product Committee, as well as other community members in the ecosystem, collect more data we will submit the following info actions to refine and incorporate these. (See full proposed KPIs [here](https://product.cardano.intersectmbo.org/vision/strategy-2030#core-key-performance-indicators-kpis))\n\n### Constitutionality checklist\n\nThis proposal does not require per se Constitutional Committee approval. However, as it is intended to support what is already expressed in the Cardano Constitution and, if approved, to provide a shared direction for the broader community, we encourage and welcome the current Constitutional Committee to review and, if they see fit, support this info action.\n\n### Why you should support this proposal\n\nSupporting the Cardano 2030 Vision and Strategy is essential because it provides **DReps** with a crucial **strategic measuring stick** for effective governance and treasury resource allocation. This document, which includes five Strategic Pillars and associated KPIs, gives DReps a community-vetted filter to rigorously evaluate funding requests and initiatives. It enables them to ask: *Does this proposal advance Cardano toward its 2030 Vision of being the most secure, reliable, and censorship-resistant blockchain for mission-critical applications?* **Crucially, this framework is designed to inform voting, not enforce it.** The Vision is a strategic document, not a constitutional one; it provides a shared direction to channel collective effort, but it **does not compel DReps to vote in a specific manner** and **has no bearing on the constitutionality of any future proposal or action**. By adopting this vision, the community gains the strategic discipline to focus resources and accelerate coherent, long-term growth.\n\nWe invite DReps and SPOs to attach metadata with rationale and feedback to their votes on this action.",
          "motivation": "### Why a Defined Vision Matters Now More Than Ever\n\nIn the rapidly evolving blockchain landscape, a clear and articulated vision is no longer a luxury, but a necessity. For Cardano, establishing a forward-looking Vision 2030 is crucial to ensure sustained growth, focused innovation, and broad legitimacy.\n\n* **Infra-first limits:** Technical robustness alone does not attract developers or users; without direction, ecosystems fragment and stagnate.  \n* **Clarifying Cardano\u2019s purpose:** Cardano must clearly articulate why it exists and what unique problems it solves to stand out among capable competitors.  \n* **Strategy beyond features:** Past roadmaps focused on *how* to build, not *why*. A vision ties technical progress to real-world users, markets, and outcomes  \n* **Measuring stick:** An established Strategy with KPIs gives DReps a measuring stick they can use to evaluate proposals against.\n\n### The Risks of Operating Without a Unified Vision\n\nLack of a shared long-term vision exposes Cardano to major strategic risks:\n\n* **Misallocation of resources:** Talent, treasury, and community energy scatter across low-impact efforts.  \n* **Hijacked narratives:** Hype cycles and trends can unintentionally steer the ecosystem without intentional Strategy.  \n* **Loss of differentiation:** Without clear strengths, Cardano becomes interchangeable with other L1s.  \n* **Outpaced by focused rivals:** Competitors that target specific niches with clear intent can outperform broad, unfocused ecosystems.\n\n### The Strategic Investment in Clarity\n\nBuilding a strong vision requires deliberate choices\u2014and trade-offs:\n\n* **Prioritization means exclusion:** A meaningful vision must guide DReps to choose who and what Cardano serves best.  \n* **Focus requires trade-offs:** Differentiation makes Cardano highly suited for some use cases and less for others.  \n* **Alignment requires discipline:** Saying \u201cno\u201d to initiatives that don\u2019t support the vision strengthens execution and coherence.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nA shared, well-defined vision is foundational to Cardano\u2019s next decade. It guides development, reduces strategic risk, optimizes resource use, and unifies the ecosystem around meaningful, measurable impact. This first version of Cardano 2030 proposal is essential to ensuring Cardano\u2019s continued relevance, differentiation, and long-term leadership.",

          "abstract": "This governance action proposes to add an additional Constitutional Committee member through a community-initiated Update Committee action.\n\nThe proposal is submitted independently by community participants, in accordance with Cardano\u2019s permissionless governance framework, and explicitly references the previously submitted Update Committee action whose purpose was to add Cardano Curia to the Constitutional Committee\n\nBy increasing the number of Constitutional Committee members above the `minCommitteeSize` parameter (currently set to 7), this action strengthens governance continuity and reduces the risk of ratification delays should a committee member resign or retire during the current mandate.",
          "rationale": "In accordance with the Cardano Constitution, CIP-1694, and the permissionless nature of Cardano governance, this Update Committee governance action is submitted as a community-initiated proposal to allow an additional opportunity for representation where the off-chain electoral outcome was narrowly decided.\n\nThis action does not override, invalidate, or conflict with the previously submitted Update Committee action whose purpose was to add Cardano Curia to the Constitutional Committee. Instead, it explicitly references that governance action as its required `previousGovActionId`, ensuring strict ledger ordering and consistency.\n\nBy design, this governance action cannot be ratified unless the Curia Update Committee action has already been ratified. As a result, it is structurally incapable of negating or replacing the Curia outcome.\n\n### Permissionless Community Initiative\n\nThis proposal is submitted independently, on the author\u2019s own accord, and is fully financed by community members. No institutional mandate is claimed or implied.\n\n### Non-Conflict and Ledger Safety\n\nThis governance action:\n\n* References the Curia Update Committee action as its `previousGovActionId`\n* Does not modify the Constitutional Committee voting threshold, which remains set at 67%\n* Does not remove or replace any existing committee member\n* Does not alter existing committee terms\n\nIf ratified, this action will **add one additional Constitutional Committee member**, leaving all previously enacted committee memberships and term expirations unchanged.\n\n### Proposed Committee Member\n\nThe candidate proposed by this governance action is Christina. The cold Constitutional Committee credential provided by the candidate is:\n\n| Member | Cold Credential | Term Expiration Epoch |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| Christina | keyHash-c46a3789d71bc0a27d1c381909289978797a60c5f67aa8bc2b26ab92 | 653 |\n\n#### Term Length\n\nIf ratified, the term length for Christina will be set to the same expiration epoch as Cardano Curia, which is set to expire at epoch 653. This ensures fairness and consistency with the original term length established for all participating candidates during the snap election process.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis proposal reinforces Cardano\u2019s governance resilience while respecting prior outcomes. It is submitted in the spirit of Cardano\u2019s permissionless governance model. Regardless of the outcome, its purpose is to ensure that questions of representation are resolved transparently and on-chain, by the community itself.",
          "motivation": "### Permissionless On-Chain Governance\n\nWith the activation of full on-chain governance under CIP-1694, Cardano transitioned into a governance system where any Ada holder may submit governance actions, provided they comply with constitutional guardrails and ledger rules. This permissionless design ensures that governance is not limited to institutional processes, but remains open to direct community participation.\n\n### Context of the Snap Election\n\nIntersect facilitated a snap election to fill a vacant Constitutional Committee seat following the resignation of a committee member. That process resulted in the selection and on-chain ratification of Cardano Curia through an Update Committee governance action.\n\nDuring the off-chain snap election process facilitated by Intersect, the outcome between candidates Christina and Cardano Curia was exceptionally close. While Curia was duly selected and ratified through the established process, the narrow margin demonstrated substantial community support for Christina as well.\n\n### Governance Resilience\n\nThe protocol parameter `minCommitteeSize` is currently set to 7. When the number of active Constitutional Committee members falls below this threshold, governance actions requiring Constitutional Committee ratification cannot be approved.\n\nAdding an additional committee member above this minimum threshold increases operational resilience. It ensures that, should another committee member step down or become inactive during the current mandate, the Constitutional Committee would remain capable of ratifying governance actions without interruption.\n\nThis proposal therefore seeks to reinforce governance continuity while remaining fully compliant with existing constitutional and ledger constraints.",

          "rationale": "In accordance with the constitution and its current guardrails, one committee seat was elected to restore continuity. The elected member will have their term expiration to match the retired seat, serving until epoch 653.\n\nFollowing the tallying of off-chain stake-weighted votes, the candidate with the highest amount of participating DRep voting stake was elected.\n\nThis governance action officially endorses the results of that electoral process, proposing the composition of the committee with its staggered terms installed when the interim CC transition to full community control.  \n\nThe audited results recorded a total of 3,160,499,917 participating stake represented by 88 DReps on the Ekklesia platform.

By filling the vacant seat promptly it seeks to maintain continuity in Cardano\u2019s on-chain governance and aligns with Article VII, Section 3 of the Cardano Constitution:\n\n*\u201cThe Cardano Community shall establish and make public a process from time to time for election of members of the Constitutional Committee consistent with the requirements of the Guardrails.\u201d*\n\nThis election follows the same principles as the Constitutional Committee election held earlier this year (to replace the Interim Committee), but in a condensed format given the urgency and importance of restoring the minimum Constitutional Committee membership:\n\n* **Adhering to the Cardano Constitution:** Ensuring all procedures were compliant with the foundational rules of the ecosystem.  \n* **Accessible**: Allowing any Ada owner to register as a candidate.  \n* **Transparent and Verifiable**: Building trust through an open process with verifiable, on-chain results.\n\nThe off-chain phase of the election process ran between November 17th 2025 - December 9th 2025, and included distinct periods for candidate applications, DRep voting on Ekklesia, and a final audit, prior to this on-chain governance action.",
          "motivation": "### Emergence of Governance\n\nThe Chang Hard Fork was initiated by the Genesis Key Holders and approved by stake pool operators becoming effective on September 1st, 2024. Deploying initial on-chain governance features to Cardano and ushering in an interim (or technical bootstrap phase) for Cardano governance. This instated an interim Constitutional Committee, including the founding entities, three community consortiums and Intersect for an 74 epoch term (~1 year).\n\nThe second upgrade, known as Plomin, moved governance out of the interim and technical bootstrap phase into full minimum viable on-chain governance as described in [CIP-1694 | A First Step Towards On-Chain Decentralized Governance](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/blob/master/CIP-1694/README.md).\n\n### Replacing the Interim Constitutional Committee\n\nWith the interim Constitutional Committee term nearing an end, Intersect hosted an election process from May 5th to July 6th, 2025. This process intended to transition  the interim Constitutional Committee into full community control, electing seven members.\n\nDReps and stake pool operators ratified and enacted the Constitutional Committee on-chain via an Update Committee action [gov_action1g7sw\u2026.pyyt](https://cardanoscan.io/govAction/gov_action1g7sw0f8e8qa34lppj2erksvzf4j6e9udwaq6efslc8apdqeazygsq2spyyt).\n\n### Constitutional Committee Member Retiring\n\nDuring epoch 597, a Constitutional Committee member - Cardano Atlantic Council resigned from the Committee, before the end of their current term. Formally submitting their retirement certificate within transaction [7e9e3\u2026.9cc59](https://cardanoscan.io/transaction/7e9e3621aa95b51f90117ddde998e67a38f98b169f42cb12a2b7134bf089cc59).\n\n### Impact\n\nFrom epoch 597 the Constitutional Committee has had six members, bringing the total member count below the `committeeMinSize` parameter, currently set at seven.\n\nHaving a smaller Constitutional Committee than `committeeMinSize` means that the Constitutional Committee is unable to ratify any new governance actions - limiting Cardano\u2019s on-chain governance functionality. Only governance actions not requiring Constitutional Committee ratification are able to pass, namely Update Committee/Threshold, Info Actions*, and Motion of no-confidence.\n\nElecting a new committee member is essential to ensure the seamless continuation of Cardano governance.\n\n**Budgets and Net Change Limits are Info Actions, but these do require Constitutional Committee consideration.*",

This governance action  requests to withdraw \u20b370,000,000 from the Cardano Treasury to establish a strategic integration fund supporting the onboarding of critical infrastructure, including tier-one stablecoins, institutional digital asset custody and wallet infrastructures, on-chain analytics platforms, cross-chain bridges, and pricing oracles to the Cardano ecosystem.\n\nThese integrations are foundational for tier-one stablecoin deployment, large scale DeFi growth, and acceleration of RWA and DePin activity, strengthening Cardano\u2019s long term fee generation and treasury sustainability. This project is being driven through close collaboration between Input | Output Global, the Cardano Foundation, and EMURGO, together with Midnight Foundation and Intersect, all of whom are actively engaged in negotiations with integration partners. Representatives from all five organizations form the Steering Committee, which is responsible for all executive decisions over how these funds will be committed and spent. Multiple partners are already at an executable stage, but with sensitive commercial negotiations underway, vendor identities and line item costs remain confidential. Vendor identities can only be disclosed once integrations are completed.\n\nFunds will be administered by Intersect under a performance and milestone-based structure over a period of up to 24 months. Drawdowns occur only after signed integration partnership agreements are submitted and verified. The Oversight Committee, a group of five independent entities within Intersect's budget administration framework, will review each drawdown or disbursal to confirm alignment between scope, amounts, and recipients. Deployment is expected to begin shortly after enactment of this withdrawal.",
          "rationale": "The Cardano Critical Integrations Budget will use the requested \u20b370,000,000 to cover:\n\n**\u2022 Integration and other necessary associated costs**  \nCover the integration work and all related expenses, including deployment development, licensing fees, maintenance costs, and any additional infrastructure required to support the integrations.\n\n**\u2022 Legal and Audit**  \nCover due diligence, legal, insurance, and compliance requirements, and periodic independent audits to satisfy the requirements of the Cardano Constitution.\n\n**\u2022 Contingency Reserve**  \nMaintain a reserve to accommodate scope adjustments or market shifts, while preserving delivery certainty and financial discipline.\n\n**\u2022 Admin Fees**  \nCover custody fees, minting fees of stablecoins, and any other administrative costs that may arise during setup and execution of the Cardano Critical Integrations Budget.\n\n\u20b370,000,000 reflects the estimated remaining capacity under the 2025 Net Change Limit and is based on consolidated cost estimates across the priority integration pipeline. This level of funding provides sufficient runway to secure high impact integrations as they become executable, allowing the Steering Committee to move quickly and support multi-year commercial terms where required.\n\n### High-level budget breakdown\n\nAs stated in the corresponding Budget Info Action, confidentiality obligations applied by most integration partners limit the level of detail that can be publicly disclosed. For that reason, this breakdown is presented on a high level, roughly estimated basis and does not include vendor specific line items. The Steering Committee is being entrusted with all executive decisions on how to use these funds to advance the interests of the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem and unused funds at the end of the 24 month period will be returned to the Cardano Treasury.\n\nWe acknowledge DReps feedback on the budget breakdown and we recognize the balance the community expects between transparency and the commercial realities of negotiations. In complex, multi party technical integrations, contracting and delivery naturally take time, and partners often require confidentiality while agreements are being finalized. Most business contracts include confidentiality terms, and it's common for these terms to specifically mention and protect sensitive deal-related information like costs, as well as other financial data, strategies, and proprietary information. These provisions, often in the form of a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) or a clause within a larger contract, are essential for protecting a company's competitive edge. We take those obligations seriously, because honoring them is essential to securing and maintaining these relationships for the ecosystem.\n\nWithin those limits, we will share as much as partner agreements allow. This includes:  \n \u2022 Integration categories and high level scope  \n \u2022 Milestone completion and progress updates  \n \u2022 Aggregate spend reporting  \n \u2022 Outcomes delivered\n\nWhile some integrations will require a degree of longer-term assurance to the contracting party, exit terms are part of the negotiation and any unreasonable exclusivity or \u2018lock in\u2019 clauses will be avoided.\n\nWe anticipate that achieving our full vision may require additional funding in future governance cycles, but this initial allocation allows us to demonstrate value and action before requesting further resources. Requests for further funding will require an additional Budget Info Action, which will entail reporting to the Community of work delivered to date in order to allow the DReps to vote on the additional budget.\n\nA high-level, preliminary, budget breakdown is provided below, this may be updated in time in subsequent reporting, insofar as confidentiality obligations allow:\n\n| Category | Allocation (\u20b3) | Allocation % | Description |\n| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |\n| **Integration costs** | 65,000,000 | 93% | It includes the full range of fees required for the integrations referenced in the Motivation section, including integration, licensing, and maintenance fees, as well as other related costs. |\n| **Legal, contract administration, and compliance costs**  | 3,500,000 | 5% | Due diligence, independent audits, and legal & compliance |\n| **Contingency Reserve** | 1,500,000  | 2% | Flexibility for scope or market shifts |\n| **Total** | **70,000,000** |  |  |\n\n### **Administration of Funds**\n\nThis treasury withdrawal is submitted by Intersect in its role as the Administrator, with endorsement and the collaboration of the Cardano Foundation, Input Output Global, and EMURGO as co-proposers. All treasury funds will be administered by Intersect as an Administrator under Cardano\u2019s constitutional framework. All treasury funds for this initiative will be administered by Intersect under Article IV of the Constitution, using the Treasury Reserve Smart Contract Framework. Intersect acts as the Administrator for the entire budget. Contracting for integrations will be assigned by the Steering Committee based on the \u2018best fit\u2019 entity that has the required skills, stability, and capacity.\n\n#### Steering Committee Authority\n\nThe Steering Committee will negotiate commercial terms with integration partners and will include a technical assessment of feasibility and implementation requirements.\n\nAllocations from this budget will be approved by the Steering Committee. The quorum for any budget allocation to an integration will be 3/4 of all Steering Committee members. Once an integration is approved, Intersect will administer and execute the associated disbursements to the contracting entity, as defined for each integration.\n\nThe Steering Committee will publish progress reports upon achieving integration milestones\n\n## **Role of Intersect and Contractual Counterparties**\n\nIntersect will receive the funds and administer this budget. Intersect will also, in its capacity as a Constitutional Administrator, receive regular reporting and insight into budget expenditure. Upon enactment of this governance action, the funds will be received into the Treasury Reserve Smart Contract framework administered by Intersect with withdrawal data verification provided by the independent smart contract Oversight Committee made up of five members; the Cardano Foundation, NMKR, Xerberus, SundaeLabs, and Dquadrant. Cardano Foundation will abstain where appropriate should a conflict of interest arise between this role and its role in the Steering Committee.\n\nFunds from there will be disbursed according to the contracting arrangements. Disbursements will be made directly from the smart contract framework or an institutional-grade custodian to vendors, as selected by the Steering Committee. It is currently not envisioned that the smart contract framework deployed earlier this year will be fully utilized in so far as specific vendor smart contracts being established as this will likely result in disclosure of integration costs, which are typically confidential and protected by non-disclosure agreements. For the sake of completeness and as mentioned previously, the main Treasury Reserve Smart Contract will be the recipient address for this withdrawal, which remains in constitutional compliance. Intersect and the co-proposers will endeavor to negotiate integration contracts that allow for as much public disclosure as reasonably possible and the Steering Committee will disclose such information in their progress reports.\n\nCo-proposers or other entities chosen by the Steering Committee from time to time may, if required, act as the contracting counterparty with an integration partner. When this occurs, Intersect and the Cardano Development Holdings will enter into a contract with the designated entity defining the scope, obligations, reporting requirements, and drawdown conditions. Under this arrangement, the designated entity receives disbursements from related smart contract/s or custodians as determined by the contract terms.\n\nIntersect will only act as a contracting counterparty when it has completed its own due diligence and satisfied its Delivery Assurance standards. If Intersect declines to act as counterparty for a specific integration, another designated entity may do so, provided that a contract is established between that designated entity, Intersect and Cardano Development Holdings for the purpose of receiving and managing budget disbursements.\n\nAll contracts established under this program will include clearly defined scope, obligations, reporting requirements, drawdown conditions, and dispute resolution provisions, in order to comply with Article IV.4 of the Constitution.\n\n## **Payment Execution and Safeguards**\n\nDisbursements will be executed through either smart contracts or institutional-grade custodians. These disbursements will follow the Statements of Work and the commercial terms approved by the Steering Committee.\n\n## **Unused funds and program conclusion**\n\nIf at the end of the 24 months period the budget has not been fully utilized, all remaining funds will be returned to the Cardano Treasury. A final reconciliation and summary will be included in the oversight reporting by Intersect, in collaboration with the Steering Committee.\n\n### **Cardano Addresses**\n\nTreasury funds will be received and held by Intersect, acting as the Constitutional Administrator,  the following address addr1xxzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6v9swzhujsjlls7dajp59u95re0qdk9vh8mumlemw89535s4ecqxj (with stake account stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr) which is publicly viewable.\n\nTo fulfil constitutional requirements, this address will be delegated to the Auto-Abstain DRep and will not be staked to any Stake Pool Operator (SPO), ensuring that the funds do not influence governance or generate staking rewards. Intersect will ensure oversight and transparency through the independent audit and access to information.\n\nThrough this arrangement, the Cardano Development Holdings administered by Intersect, maintains full custody transparency, enabling verifiable auditing and milestone tracking under Cardano\u2019s constitutional governance framework, satisfying Articles IV(2), (4) & (5) in particular.\n\n### **Acceptance Criteria and Milestone-Based Disbursement**\n\nThe acceptance criteria will vary between vendors, but will be made public once commercial terms and contracting has been agreed between the vendor, Intersect and the Steering Committee. It is expected a \u201cmilestone zero\u201d payment will cover the essential setup costs of this initiative, which may include converting ada into a stablecoin, stablecoin minting fees, and custody fees. Converted assets will be held in a regulated custodian. Legal costs for onboarding integration partners are also included in this early operational budget.\n\nAny conversion of ada into stablecoins or other assets will occur only as part of an approved disbursement under a Statement of Work, and only after the relevant ada has left the Administrator\u2019s dedicated, auto abstain delegated accounts in accordance with Article IV.5.\n\nIn general, integration partners will receive funds only after verified delivery of agreed technical and operational milestones. That said, payment structures may vary deal to deal. Where a partner requires funds in advance to commence delivery, an upfront payment may be made at the point of contract signature.\n\nIntegrations requiring ongoing support may receive additional approved maintenance payments during the program period.\n\nThis disbursement structure ensures efficient execution, transparent financial management, and strict alignment with Cardano\u2019s governance requirements.\n\n### **Reporting**\n\nIntersect and the Steering Committee will publish a bi-annual report covering:\n\n1. **Financial Summary & Treasury Reconciliation** \u2013 total funds disbursed, remaining, and audited.  \n2. **Project Progress & Milestone Review** \u2013 integration status and outcomes.  \n3. **Audit & Compliance Statement** \u2013 summary of independent audit findings.  \n4. **Ecosystem Impact Assessment** \u2013 measurable effects on Cardano adoption and interoperability.  \n5. **Governance & Future Outlook** \u2013 proposed next steps or renewal recommendations.\n\n## **Constitutionality Checklist**\n\n### **Article III.5**\n\n\u2714\ufe0f This proposal is prepared in a standardized and legible format and will include a URL and hash of all off-chain materials at submission. It provides a clear title, abstract, rationale, motivation, and supporting information in accordance with this article.\n\n### **Article IV.1**\n\n\u2714\ufe0f This proposal fits the purpose of Article IV.1 as it supports the maintenance, operation, and future development of the Cardano ecosystem through critical integrations.\n\n### **Article IV.2**\n\n\u2714\ufe0f This proposal specifies Intersect as the administrator and outlines transparent reporting, an oversight structure and explains where the processes are or are not administered via smart contracts (where it is not possible or beneficial). These elements meet the constitutional requirement for the use of administrators and on-chain tools where beneficial.\n\n### **Article IV.3**\n\n\u2714\ufe0f \u201d2025 Net Change Limit Extension\u201d Info Action (gov_action169kllwhfmp488je5x5rwvufd08p8sztdcf0ghf5sp6ey2gnjdwaqql47xry) to extend the 2025 NCL is currently underway. If accepted, the NCL will remain in effect from Epoch 605 to Epoch 612, removing any ambiguity in covering this proposal\u2019s withdrawal window and keeping the \u20b370,000,000 request within the applicable NCL, thereby satisfying Article IV.3.\n\n\u2714\ufe0f This treasury withdrawal will be made in alignment with the relevant Budget Info Action.\n\n### **Article IV.4**\n\n\u2714\ufe0f This proposal allocates a budget for independent audits and includes clear oversight metrics & mechanisms such as contractual milestone-based verification, bi-yearly reporting, dispute resolution provisions (to be included in relevant legal contracts), and a defined Steering Committee. These elements satisfy the constitutional requirements for audits and oversight metrics.\n\n### **Article IV.5**\n\n\u2714\ufe0f All ADA withdrawn will be held by Intersect in dedicated, publicly viewable addresses that will not be delegated to any SPO and will be delegated to the Auto-Abstain voting option.\n\n### **GUARDRAILS: TREASURY 02a**\n\n\u2714\ufe0f This treasury withdrawal confirms that the requested \u20b370,000,000 will not breach the applicable Net Change Limit for the relevant period at submission or enactment (subject to the NCL extension being approved).\n\n### **GUARDRAILS: TREASURY 03a**\n\n\u2714\ufe0f The requested amount in this proposal is denominated in ADA\n\n### **GUARDRAILS: TREASURY 04a**\n\n\u2714\ufe0f This treasury withdrawal will only be eligible for ratification after, and only if, the community approved the corresponding Budget Info Action in effect with DRep approval above the 50 percent threshold. This sequencing aligns with the prerequisite budget requirement for withdrawals.",
          "motivation": "### **Strategic Need**\n\nCardano has a strong technical and governance foundation, but lacks several critical integrations required for large-scale economic activity and external liquidity. The absence of key systems, including stablecoin infrastructures, interoperability frameworks, and institutional-grade pricing oracle networks limits the ecosystem\u2019s capacity to attract external capital, facilitate stable on-chain operations, and support advanced DeFi use cases. Cardano also requires institutional digital asset custody and wallet infrastructures, as well as on-chain analytics platforms to ensure user access, ecosystem transparency, and multi-chain liquidity efficiency. While none of these integrations in themselves are \u2018silver bullets\u2019, taken as a whole, they will provide the essential foundations to connect Cardano to the wider Web3 landscape and pave the way for accelerated growth.\n\n* **Stablecoins**  \n  With data and interoperability in place, Cardano can support the introduction of a tier-one stablecoin, the ecosystem\u2019s primary base currency. A stablecoin provides price stability, predictable liquidity, and access for both institutional and retail users. However, its deployment depends on reliable oracle data and established interoperability channels. As such, stablecoin integration is the final step in the infrastructure rollout sequence and the key enabler for large-scale DeFi adoption and sustained liquidity growth.\n\n* **Institutional Digital Asset Custodies and Wallet Infrastructures**  \n  User access and transaction flow depend on a high-quality wallet infrastructure that supports multi-asset management, seamless dApp interaction, and secure cross-chain functionality. Wallets serve as the primary interface between users and Cardano\u2019s financial systems; therefore, scalable, reliable, and feature-rich wallet solutions are required to support onboarding, institutional usage, and mass-market adoption. Enhanced wallet capabilities also ensure that new infrastructure layers like bridges, analytics, and stablecoins remain accessible and usable for all users.\n\n* **On-chain Analytics Platforms**  \n  A mature financial ecosystem requires transparent, real-time insights into network activity, risk exposure, asset flows, and application performance. Advanced analytics platforms allow developers, institutions, compliance teams, and users to assess liquidity conditions, monitor protocol health, and make informed decisions. Without robust analytics, DeFi operations remain opaque, limiting institutional participation and hindering ecosystem-wide risk management.\n\n* **Cross-Chain Bridges**  \n  Once a reliable data layer is established, the next requirement is enabling liquidity and user movement between Cardano and other ecosystems. Bridge and interoperability infrastructures allow assets to transfer securely across blockchains, opening access to external liquidity pools and new user bases. Without these routes, Cardano remains isolated, constraining inflows of capital, developers, and institutional participants.\n\n* **Pricing Oracle Infrastructures**  \n  Oracles provide the external data required for DeFi & RWA operations, including asset pricing, risk management, and stablecoin collateralization. While current native providers deliver early coverage, Cardano still lacks a globally recognized, institution-grade pricing oracle provider. This limitation restricts the ability of major stablecoin issuers and financial applications to deploy on Cardano, as their operations require data from trusted pricing oracle networks. Establishing a robust pricing oracle infrastructure is the foundational step in enabling higher-level financial systems.\n\nThese integrations will provide the capability \u2018rails\u2019 for increased liquidity flow to Cardano which impact across \u2018downstream\u2019 metrics such as monthly active users, transaction volume, DeFi Total Value Locked (TVL), stablecoin liquidity/volume and more. However, people, incentives, products, and narratives are still needed to attract users and drive economic flow. As such, clear ecosystem KPIs, derived from the Cardano 2030 strategy that will be voted on via Info Action as a pillar of the 2026 budget, must be validated with the community as a separate workstream. Similar integrations are commonplace across leading L1 projects and, when combined with supporting activities and incentives to drive awareness and user onboarding, have demonstrated positive liquidity inflows and network value.\n\n### **Current Gap & Urgency**:\n\nDespite being a top-10 blockchain by market cap, Cardano\u2019s TVL as of November 25, 2025 remains around $191.86 million (Source: Defillama.com), which is still far below comparable ecosystems in DeFi trading volume and TVL. This gap highlights Cardano\u2019s limited market reach and the absence of the core primitives that other networks treat as standard utilities. Without scaling these key components, Cardano risks falling further behind in attracting dApps, liquidity, institutional partners, and large-scale integrations such as tier-one stablecoins.\n\nCardano\u2019s growth now depends on institution grade pricing oracles and interoperability layers linking on chain applications to external networks and real world data. These integrations are capital intensive and time sensitive, yet foundational for every future financial primitive. This proposal is advanced now because priority negotiations have reached an executable stage and can be finalized upon funding.\n\n### **Why Treasury Funding**\n\nThe Cardano ecosystem needs foundational public infrastructure that every dApp depends on. Certain components cannot practically be built or licensed by individual teams; they are shared utilities that must be delivered at ecosystem scale, to unlock liquidity, attract users and developers, and enable institutional use cases. The Constitution states \u201cThe Cardano Community is expected to periodically propose one or more budgets for the ongoing operation, maintenance and future development of the Cardano\u201d.\n\nBy placing the budget under Intersect administration, all fund flows follow constitutional guardrails: separate auditable addresses, auto-abstain delegation, milestone validation, independent audits, dispute resolution, and public reporting. This ensures full community oversight from start to finish and reinforces decentralized governance across the entire integration pipeline.\n\n### **Timeline & Current State of Governance**\n\nThis Treasury Withdrawal is submitted in parallel with the \u201cCardano Critical Integrations Budget\u201d Info Action and the recent \u201c2025 Net Change Limit Extension\u201d Info Action. Running these actions together allows DReps to consider the full budget and the concrete withdrawal at the same time.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Treasury Withdrawal may only be enacted if, at the time of enactment:\n\n* The Cardano Critical Integrations Budget Info Action has been approved by DReps at the required threshold and has not been determined unconstitutional by the Constitutional Committee  \n* The withdrawal is being made pursuant to an approved Net Change Limit; the Constitutional Committee is in a state of confidence, is at or above its minimum required size and has voted that this Treasury Withdrawal is Constitutional.\n\nWhile this Treasury Withdrawal runs in parallel with the related Info Actions it is slightly staggered, so that DReps are able to signal their support in conjunction with the ongoing Budget Info Action, and the Constitutional Committee members will have a period of time after the Budget Info Action voting closes to assess constitutionality of this Treasury Withdrawal within the applicable govActionLifetime.\n\nIf any of these conditions are not met, including if the Cardano Critical Integrations Budget Info Action fails, if the Net Change Limit extension Info Action fails or is not in force for the relevant period, or if the Constitutional Committee is not restored to at least its minimum size, then the Treasury Withdrawal may be deemed unconstitutional.\n\n### **Steering Committee**\n\nThe Steering Committee provides high-level business direction and integration governance of this initiative. The committee oversees negotiation strategy, prioritization of integrations, and overall alignment with Cardano\u2019s ecosystem needs. Its purpose is to ensure that each integration delivers clear strategic value and that decisions are made in the best interest of the ecosystem.\n\nThe Steering Committee operates as a five-member group representing Input | Output Global, the Cardano Foundation, EMURGO, Midnight Foundation and Intersect. These members act independently to maintain neutrality. Together, they evaluate which integrations should be onboarded first, assess ecosystem impact, and guide the negotiation of commercial and contracting terms with integration partners. The Steering Committee voting members will not be compensated from withdrawn funds and will each cover their own expenses. An amount of no more than 5% of the budget will be allocated to legal, custodian fees, administration, and compliance costs of the Administrator and connected parties.\n\nThe Steering Committee comprises representatives from each of the following organizations:\n\n* Input | Output Group  \n* Cardano Foundation  \n* EMURGO  \n* Midnight Foundation  \n* Intersect (as a non-voting member acting in the capacity of the Administrator)\n\nWhile ultimate accountability and delegated authority sits with the Steering Committee, dedicated sub-working groups will take operational responsibility across key areas such as commercial, legal, technical delivery, and communications/community engagement. Conflict of interest policies will be applied to the Steering Committee and the Treasury Reserve Smart Contract Oversight Committee members when making allocation and disbursal decisions.\n\nIn order to expedite these workstreams, a clear structure is required to ensure responsibility and accountability, both between the Steering Committee members organizations and to the community. While some elements of this structure are still being finalized, the intent is clear: collective action where coordination improves efficiency, combined with individual accountability so that responsibilities cannot become diffuse or ambiguous. For the avoidance of doubt, Intersect in its role as Administrator, commits to administering funds for the sole purpose as defined in the Budget Info Action and this Treasury Withdrawal.",

          "title": "2025 Net Change Limit Extension",
          "abstract": "The Cardano Community adopted the 2025 Net Change Limit (NCL) on 24 April 2025, which defined the maximum amount of lovelace that could be withdrawn from the Cardano Treasury from the start of Epoch 532 until the conclusion of Epoch 604. Because the Cardano Constitution does not allow withdrawals from the Treasury that would violate the established NCL, this \"2025 Net Change Limit Extension\" serves the purpose of extending the previously established Net Change Limit for an additional eight (8) Epochs so that management of the Cardano Treasury will not be disrupted.",
          "rationale": "Withdrawals from the Cardano Blockchain Treasury that would cause the Treasury balance to violate the applicable NCL are not permitted under Article IV, Section 3 of the Cardano Constitution and the Treasury Guardrails. Because the \"2025 Net Change Limit\" explicitly states that its term ends at the close of Epoch 604, any Treasury Withdrawal Governance Action (TWGA) that relies on that NCL must be both ratified and enacted before that point. Given the one-epoch enactment delay for Treasury Withdrawals, where a Governance Action that is ratified at one Epoch boundary is only enacted and paid out at the next Epoch boundary, the last Epoch in which such a TWGA may validly be ratified is Epoch 603 (ending 30 December 2025). Any TWGA ratified in Epoch 604 could not be enacted until the Epoch 605 boundary, after the current NCL term has expired, and therefore cannot be constitutionally authorized under that NCL.\n\nAs agreed with the Cardano Budget Committee of Intersect MBO, the original 2025 NCL was to begin at the start of Epoch 532 and progress for 72 epochs, concluding at the end of Epoch 604 - which is 4 January 2026. It should be noted that there was a typographical error in the original 2025 NCL GA that said it would last until 30 December 2025, but the Constitutional Committee at that time accepted 4 January 2026 as the actual ending date of the NCL because it is the conclusion of Epoch 604. The 2025 NCL was set at 350,000,000,000,000 lovelace (350M ada).\n\nWe propose that this previously established Net Change Limit be extended for additional eight (8) Epochs, so that it will now end at the conclusion of Epoch 612 (8 February 2026). All previous spending will continue to be counted so that the original limit socialized and agreed upon by the Cardano Community will not be exceeded.\n\nThis limit shall be applied in assessing budget actions and treasury withdrawal actions to ensure compliance with Article IV of the Cardano Constitution and the Treasury Withdrawal Guardrails specified in Appendix I.\n\nThe provisions set forth in the Cardano Constitution state that the approval of a Net Change Limit requires a threshold of greater than 50% of the active voting DRep stake. Therefore, this extension of the 2025 Net Change Limit for an additional eight (8) Epochs will be considered passed if it receives DRep support greater than 50% of the Active Governance State and the Constitutional Committee deems it to be Constitutional.",
          "motivation": "We seek to have this Governance Action adopted so that the management of the Cardano Treasury will not be disrupted by the expiration of the current NCL.",

          "abstract": "This Cardano Critical Integrations Budget Governance Action requests \u20b370,000,000 from the Cardano Treasury to establish a strategic integration fund supporting the onboarding of critical infrastructure, including tier-one stablecoins, institutional digital asset custody and wallet infrastructures, on-chain analytics platforms, cross-chain bridges, and pricing oracles to the Cardano ecosystem.\n\nThis infrastructure establishes the foundational layer required to onboard tier-one stablecoins, with the potential to unlock exponential growth in DeFi transaction volume across the ecosystem. It will also help accelerate ecosystem efforts in other key areas such as Real World Assets (RWA) and DePin. This acceleration is expected to play a key role in supporting Cardano\u2019s path to profitability as a layer one in terms of fee generation, ensuring long-term financial sustainability.\n\nThis project is being driven through close collaboration between Input | Output Global, the Cardano Foundation, and EMURGO, together with Midnight Foundation and Intersect, all of whom are actively engaged in negotiations with integration partners. Representatives from all five organizations form the Steering Committee, which is responsible for making key strategic decisions. The founding entities and Intersect also recognize the Midnight Foundation\u2019s contributions to date.\n\nInfrastructure providers and/or protocol collaborations are in a mature stage, and several partners have already provided detailed pricing and delivery timelines. However, for reasons of strategic and commercial confidentiality, together with partner companies\u2019 compliance requirements, the specific infrastructures involved can only be disclosed outside of the Steering Committee after the integration is completed.\n\nThe project will follow a milestone-based funding structure, with budget drawdowns executed from Intersect\u2019s custody and administration only upon submission of signed agreements and the agreed scope of work. The Oversight Committee at Intersect will review drawdown requests to confirm that the amounts and designated recipients align with the executed contracts. Since work is already underway in some of these areas, this proposal envisions an early early budget deployment, and we anticipate this budget being utilized immediately and up to 24-month deployment, depending on withdrawal success, contracting periods, and timely receipt.",
          "rationale": "The Cardano Critical Integrations Budget will use the requested \u20b370,000,000 to cover:\n\n**\u2022 Integration and other necessary associated costs**  \nCover the integration work and all related expenses, including deployment development, licensing fees, maintenance costs, and any additional infrastructure required to support the integrations.\n\n**\u2022 Legal and Audit**  \nCover due diligence, legal, insurance, and compliance requirements, and periodic independent audits to satisfy the requirements of the Cardano Constitution.\n\n**\u2022 Contingency Reserve**  \nMaintain a reserve to accommodate scope adjustments or market shifts, while preserving delivery certainty and financial discipline.\n\n**\u2022 Admin Fees**  \nCover custody fees, minting fees of stablecoins, and any other administrative costs that may arise during setup and execution of the Cardano Critical Integrations Budget\n\n\u20b3 70,000,000 refers to the remaining funds available within the current NCL. A high-level budget breakdown is planned to be included in the subsequent Treasury Withdrawal Governance Action following this Budget Info Action. However, due to confidentiality obligations applied by most integration partners, the breakdown will be limited in granularity. If the allocated budget is not used at the end of the 24-month period, all remaining funds will be returned to the Cardano Treasury.\n\n### **Administration of Funds**\n\nAll treasury funds will be administered by Intersect as an Administrator under Cardano\u2019s constitutional framework. All treasury funds for this initiative will be administered by Intersect under Article IV of the Constitution. Intersect acts as the administrator for the entire budget. Contracting for integrations will be assigned on the principle of budget compatibility and \u201cmost likely to succeed\u201d, i.e. to any entity that has the required skills and availability. This Budget Info Action is submitted by Intersect with support and the collaboration of the Cardano Foundation, Input Output Global, and EMURGO as co-proposers.\n\n#### Steering Committee Authority\n\nThe Steering Committee will negotiate commercial terms with integration partners and will include a technical assessment of feasibility and implementation requirements.\n\nAllocations from this budget will be approved by the Steering Committee. The quorum for any budget allocation to an integration will be 3/4 of all Steering Committee members. Once an integration is approved, Intersect will administer and execute the associated disbursements to the contracting entity, as defined for each integration.\n\nThe Steering Committee will publish progress reports upon achieving integration milestones\n\n## **Role of Intersect and Contractual Counterparties**\n\nIntersect will receive the funds and administer this budget. If this Budget Info Action and the subsequent Treasury Withdrawal are approved, funds will be received into the Treasury Reserve Smart Contract framework administered by Intersect with checks and balances from the independent smart contract Oversight Committee made up of five members; the Cardano Foundation, NMKR, Xerberus, SundaeLabs and Dquadrant. Funds from there will be disbursed transparently according to the contracting arrangements. Disbursements will be made directly from the smart contract framework or an institutional-grade custodian to vendors, as selected by the Steering Committee. It is currently not envisioned that the smart contract framework deployed earlier this year will be fully utilized, as this will likely result in disclosure of integration costs, which are typically confidential and protected by non-disclosure agreements. Intersect and the co-proposers will endeavor to negotiate integration contracts that allow for as much public disclosure as reasonably possible and the Steering Committee will disclose such information in their progress reports.\n\nCo-proposers or other entities chosen by the Steering Committee from time to time may, if required, act as the contracting counterparty with an integration partner. When this occurs, Intersect and the Cardano Development Holdings will enter into a contract with the designated entity defining the scope, obligations, reporting requirements, and drawdown conditions. Under this arrangement, the designated entity receives disbursements from related smart contract/s or custodians as determined by the contract terms.\n\nIntersect will only act as a contracting counterparty when it has completed its own due diligence and satisfied its Delivery Assurance standards. If Intersect declines to act as counterparty for a specific integration, another designated entity may do so, provided that a contract is established between that designated entity, Intersect and the for the purpose of receiving budget disbursements.\n\n## **Payment Execution and Safeguards**\n\nDisbursements will be executed through either smart contracts or institutional-grade custodians. These disbursements will follow the Statements of Work and the commercial terms approved by the Steering Committee.\n\n## **Unused funds and program conclusion**\n\nIf at the end of the 24 months period the budget has not been fully utilized, all remaining funds will be returned to the Cardano Treasury. A final reconciliation and summary will be included in the oversight reporting by Intersect, in collaboration with the Steering Committee.\n\n### **Cardano Addresses**\n\nTreasury funds will be received and held by Intersect, acting as the Constitutional Administrator, in addresses or accounts designated exclusively for this proposal and auditable by the community.\n\nTo fulfil constitutional requirements, these addresses will be delegated to the Auto-Abstain DRep and will not be staked to any Stake Pool Operator (SPO), ensuring that the funds do not influence governance or generate staking rewards. It is currently not envisioned that smart contracts will be fully used by Intersect to disbursement funds, to protect the confidentiality of vendor pricing. However, they will be used where possible and Intersect will be able to ensure oversight and transparency through the independent audit and access to information.\n\nThrough this arrangement, Intersect maintains full custody transparency, enabling verifiable auditing and milestone tracking under Cardano\u2019s constitutional governance framework, satisfying Articles IV(2), (4) & (5) in particular.\n\n### **Goals & Metrics**\n\n| Category | Target | Verification Source |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| Stablecoin | A tier-one stablecoin is targeted for deployment on Cardano mainnet as the integrations progress. | The integration is live on Cardano Mainnet. |\n| Institutional digital asset custody and wallet infrastructure | The program aims to support the deployment of a tier-one stablecoin on Cardano mainnet as delivery progresses. | The integration is live on Cardano Mainnet. |\n| On-chain analytics platform | Tier-one analytics platform targeted for mainnet. | The integration is live on Cardano Mainnet. |\n| Cross-chain bridge | A tier-one cross-chain bridge is planned for mainnet deployment as integration work with selected partners is finalised. | The integration is live on Cardano Mainnet. |\n| Pricing oracle | Tier-one pricing oracle targeted for mainnet. | The integration is live on Cardano Mainnet. |\n| Transparency compliance | Completed milestones reported through the Intersect channel. | Intersect reports. |\n| Audit completion | Annual independent audit conducted and published, following Intersect\u2019s current financial reporting framework for Tier 3 full assurance. | Intersect reports. |\n\n### **Acceptance Criteria and Milestone-Based Disbursement**\n\nThe acceptance criteria will vary between vendors, but will be made public once commercial terms and contracting has been agreed between the vendor, Intersect and the Steering Committee. It is expected a \u201cmilestone zero\u201d payment will cover the essential setup costs of this initiative, which may include converting ada into a stablecoin, stablecoin minting fees, and custody fees. Converted assets will be held in a regulated custodian. Legal costs for onboarding integration partners are also included in this early operational budget.\n\nIn general, integration partners will receive funds only after verified delivery of agreed technical and operational milestones. That said, payment structures may vary deal to deal. Where a partner requires funds in advance to commence delivery, an upfront payment may be made at the point of contract signature. Any such upfront disbursement or \u201cmilestone zero\u201d payment will be explicitly defined in the agreement and tied to a clear scope and deliverables.\n\nIntegrations requiring ongoing support may receive additional approved maintenance payments during the program period.\n\nThis disbursement structure ensures efficient execution, transparent financial management, and strict alignment with Cardano\u2019s governance requirements.\n\n### **Reporting**\n\nIntersect and the Steering Committee will publish a bi-annual report covering:\n\n1. **Financial Summary & Treasury Reconciliation** \u2013 total funds disbursed, remaining, and audited.  \n2. **Project Progress & Milestone Review** \u2013 integration status and outcomes.  \n3. **Audit & Compliance Statement** \u2013 summary of independent audit findings.  \n4. **Ecosystem Impact Assessment** \u2013 measurable effects on Cardano adoption and interoperability.  \n5. **Governance & Future Outlook** \u2013 proposed next steps or renewal recommendations.\n\n## Constitutionality Checklist\n\n### **Article III.5**\n\n\u2714\ufe0f This proposal is prepared in a standardized and legible format and will include a URL and hash of all off-chain materials at submission. It provides a clear title, abstract, rationale, motivation, and supporting information in accordance with this article.\n\n### **Article IV.1**\n\n\u2714\ufe0fThis proposal fits the purpose of Article IV.1 as it supports the maintenance, operation, and future development of the Cardano ecosystem through critical integrations.\n\n### **Article IV.2**\n\n\u2714\ufe0fThis proposal specifies Intersect as the administrator and outlines transparent reporting, an oversight structure and explains where the processes are or are not administered via smart contracts (where it is not possible or beneficial). These elements meet the constitutional requirement for the use of administrators and on-chain tools where beneficial.\n\n### **Article IV.4**\n\n\u2714\ufe0fThis proposal allocates a budget for independent audits and includes clear oversight metrics & mechanisms such as contractual milestone-based verification, bi-yearly reporting, dispute resolution provisions (to be included in relevant legal contracts), and a defined Steering Committee. These elements satisfy the constitutional requirements for audits and oversight metrics.\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nThe Cardano Critical Integrations Budget is a decisive step toward addressing one of Cardano\u2019s most pressing issues: the lack of mature oracle and interoperability integrations, alongside other core integrations required for large scale DeFi and attracting external liquidity. With these foundational integrations in place, and with tier-one stablecoin onboarding, Cardano can finally overcome the barriers that have historically prevented developers, institutions, and liquidity from other leading blockchains from entering Cardano.\n\nThis proposal unlocks the power of decentralized governance and transforms weakness into strength by allocating \u20b370,000,000 in constitutionally governed, milestone-based funding. This funding supports the full rollout sequence of ecosystem critical integrations, including institutional digital asset custody and wallet infrastructures, tier one on-chain analytics platforms, cross-chain bridges, and globally recognized pricing oracles, all of which together provide the essential data, liquidity pathways, user access, and stablecoin rails on which every thriving DeFi network relies.\n\nTransparently administered by Intersect under Cardano\u2019s governance framework and guided by an experienced Steering Committee, The Cardano Critical Integrations Budget ensures verifiable outcomes and measurable ecosystem value through clear contracting, milestone verification, and independent audits. It is a catalyst that demonstrates how decentralized governance can responsibly allocate capital while accelerating the delivery of critical integrations that will ensure Cardano\u2019s long-term competitiveness and sustainability.",
          "motivation": "### **Strategic Need**\n\nCardano has a strong technical and governance foundation, but lacks several critical integrations required for large-scale economic activity and external liquidity integration. The absence of key systems, including stablecoin infrastructures, interoperability frameworks, and institutional-grade pricing oracle networks limits the ecosystem\u2019s capacity to attract external capital, facilitate stable on-chain operations, and support advanced DeFi use cases. Cardano also requires solid institutional digital asset custody and wallet infrastructures, as well as on-chain analytics platforms to ensure user access, ecosystem transparency, and multi-chain liquidity efficiency.\n\n* **Stablecoins**  \n  With data and interoperability in place, Cardano can support the introduction of a tier-one stablecoin, the ecosystem\u2019s primary base currency. A stablecoin provides price stability, predictable liquidity, and access for both institutional and retail users. However, its deployment depends on reliable oracle data and established interoperability channels. As such, stablecoin integration is the final step in the infrastructure rollout sequence and the key enabler for large-scale DeFi adoption and sustained liquidity growth.\n\n* **Institutional Digital Asset Custodies and Wallet Infrastructures**  \n  User access and transaction flow depend on a high-quality wallet infrastructure that supports multi-asset management, seamless dApp interaction, and secure cross-chain functionality. Wallets serve as the primary interface between users and Cardano\u2019s financial systems; therefore, scalable, reliable, and feature-rich wallet solutions are required to support onboarding, institutional usage, and mass-market adoption. Enhanced wallet capabilities also ensure that new infrastructure layers like bridges, analytics, and stablecoins remain accessible and usable for all users.\n\n* **On-chain Analytics Platforms**  \n  A mature financial ecosystem requires transparent, real-time insights into network activity, risk exposure, asset flows, and application performance. Advanced analytics platforms allow developers, institutions, compliance teams, and users to assess liquidity conditions, monitor protocol health, and make informed decisions. Without robust analytics, DeFi operations remain opaque, limiting institutional participation and hindering ecosystem-wide risk management.\n\n* **Cross-Chain Bridges**  \n  Once a reliable data layer is established, the next requirement is enabling liquidity and user movement between Cardano and other ecosystems. Bridge and interoperability infrastructures allow assets to transfer securely across blockchains, opening access to external liquidity pools and new user bases. Without these routes, Cardano remains isolated, constraining inflows of capital, developers, and institutional participants.\n\n* **Pricing Oracle Infrastructures**  \n  Oracles provide the external data required for DeFi & RWA operations, including asset pricing, risk management, and stablecoin collateralization. While current native providers such as Charli3 and Orcfax deliver early coverage, Cardano still lacks a globally recognized, institution-grade pricing oracle provider. This limitation restricts the ability of major stablecoin issuers and financial applications to deploy on Cardano, as their operations require data from trusted pricing oracle networks. Establishing a robust pricing oracle infrastructure is the foundational step in enabling higher-level financial systems.\n\n### **Current Gap & Urgency**:\n\nDespite being a top-10 blockchain by market cap, Cardano\u2019s Total Value Locked (TVL) as of November 25th, 2025 remains around $191.860.000 (Source: Defillama.com), which is still far below comparable ecosystems that maintain several billion dollars in DeFi usage. This gap highlights Cardano\u2019s limited market reach and the absence of the core primitives that other networks treat as standard utilities. Without scaling these key components, Cardano risks falling further behind in attracting dApps, liquidity, institutional partners, and large-scale integrations such as tier-one stablecoins.\n\nCardano\u2019s growth requires robust pricing oracles and interoperability layers to connect on-chain applications to external networks and real-world data. These integrations are capital-intensive and time-sensitive, yet they underpin the viability of all future financial primitives.\n\nThis proposal is being brought forward now because discussions on these topics have progressed substantially, and are ready to move forward with various partners. With the current NCL set to expire on 4 January 2026, it is both timely and prudent to submit this proposal and its associated withdrawal under the present NCL, provided the community approves.\n\nBy establishing a transparent ecosystem integration budget through treasury funding, Cardano can secure these essential components rapidly and fairly.\n\n### **Why Treasury Funding**\n\n* **Ecosystem Criticality**  \n  The Cardano ecosystem needs foundational public infrastructure that every dApp depends on. These components cannot be built or licensed by individual teams; they are shared utilities that must be delivered once, at ecosystem scale, to unlock liquidity, attract developers, and enable institutional use cases.\n\n* **Neutrality & Vendor Independence**  \n  Treasury funding ensures that a broad coalition of Cardano stakeholders will determine which critical integrations are onboarded. This avoids commercial bias, guarantees neutrality, and allows the integrations to be governed transparently under Cardano\u2019s constitutional framework.\n\n* **Governance Alignment & Transparency**  \n  By placing the budget under Intersect administration, all fund flows follow constitutional guardrails: separate auditable addresses, auto-abstain delegation, milestone validation, independent audits, and public reporting. This ensures full community oversight from start to finish and reinforces decentralized governance across the entire integration pipeline.\n\n### **Timeline & Current State of Governance**\n\nThis budget info action and its associated treasury withdrawal governance action will seek to pass prior to the expiry of the current NCL on 4 January 2026. While this is an ambitious timeline, it is believed to be possible with expedient voting from DReps and the CC, and justified on the underlying need for this proposal and motivation expressed above.\n\nThe withdrawal timeline is envisaged as follows:\n\n* 27 November 2025: Submission of this budget info action.  \n* As early as the 4 December 2025: Provided there is sufficient DRep approval at this stage and signs are not overwhelmingly negative, the associated treasury withdrawal will be submitted in parallel to allow DReps to consider the withdrawal and begin voting. This will still be subject to the CC vote and passing of this budget info action.  \n* 8 December 2025: The update CC governance action will be launched (based on current timelines announced by Intersect)  \n* 30 December 2025: This budget info action expires\n* 4 January 2026: Provided that the new CC is appointed; the CC have voted; DReps have approved the budget info action and DReps have cast sufficient votes for the treasury withdrawal - then the treasury withdrawal will pass on the final day of the current NCL.\n\nThe treasury withdrawal will not be deemed constitutional until the budget info action passes on 30 December 2025 (if DReps and CC approve), however, DReps will be able to vote on the actions and express their view from as early as 4 December 2025. CC members may also cast preliminary opinions on constitutionality during the period of voting on the budget info action, and finalise their opinions on the treasury withdrawal between 30 December 2025 and 4 January 2026.\n\nIt is fully acknowledged that there are multiple dependencies to the passing of the treasury withdrawal governance action, however it is technically feasible with sufficient community support, which we hope to receive.\n\n### **Steering Committee**\n\nThe Steering Committee provides high-level business direction and integration governance of this initiative. The committee oversees negotiation strategy, prioritization of integrations, and overall alignment with Cardano\u2019s ecosystem needs. Its purpose is to ensure that each integration delivers clear strategic value and that strategic decisions are made transparently, rationally, and in the best interest of the ecosystem.\n\nThe Steering Committee operates as a five-member group representing Input | Output Global, the Cardano Foundation, EMURGO, Midnight Foundation and Intersect. These members act independently to maintain neutrality. Together, they evaluate which integrations should be onboarded first, assess ecosystem impact, and guide the negotiation of commercial and contracting terms with integration partners. The Steering Committee voting members will not be compensated from withdrawn funds and will each cover their own expenses. An amount of no more than 5% of the budget will be allocated to legal, custodian fees, administration, and compliance costs of the Administrator and connected parties.\n\nThe Steering Committee comprises representatives from each of the following organizations:\n\n* Input | Output Global  \n* Cardano Foundation  \n* EMURGO  \n* Midnight Foundation  \n* Intersect (as a non-voting member acting in the capacity of the Administrator)",

This was only a symbolic governance action, as it simply asked the community whether they agreed with a statement thanking those that helped get Cardano to this point and expressing a sense of hope for the future.\n\nUnfortunately, due to a bug in the code of the Cardano node that permitted an unregistered stake key to be used in the governance action, the submitter was unable to recover their deposit of 100K ada. While the community expressed at the time the importance of reimbursing this deposit via a treasury withdrawal; once the ability to do so became available, following the Plomin hard fork; unfortunately none of the entity based budget submissions have included this.\n\nThe Cardano in Oceania initiative did include the deposit reimbursement in their budget Info governance action, however their governance action was not approved. This governance action therefore aims to resolve this outstanding issue.",
          "rationale": "This is a budget Info governance action requesting an amount of 103,000 ada. In addition to the original 100,000 ada the Ikigai Info governance action submitter lost, they have since lost staking rewards, Midnight airdrop eligibility and other opportunities.  This budget therefore includes an additional 3,000 ada to compensate for additional losses.\n\n#### Constitutionality checklist\n\n**Article III.5:** The process of on-chain governance - This governance action has been submitted in a standardised, legible format with the minimum content required and a hash of the content.\n\n**Article IV.2:** Funds administration - While funds administration is not required, as the funds are being immediately distributed, in order to comply with this requirement the DReps are nominated as the \u201cAdministrator\u201d, as they will be responsible for executing the distribution.\n\n**Article IV.3:** Net-Change Limit - The requested amount does not exceed the current Net-Change Limit.\n\n**Article IV.4:** Auditor - As the funds will be made available directly to the intended recipient, the Cardano community will be able to audit the distribution on-chain.\n",
          "motivation": "There was significant sentiment at the time that the Ikigai Info governance action deposit should be reimbursed. It was considered that the submitter should not lose one hundred thousand ada, for being an early pioneer of Cardano governance.",

          "abstract": "This proposal seeks a 5,000,000 ada budget loan from the Cardano Treasury to fund the Cardano Global Listing Expansion, a strategic initiative led by the Snek Foundation to list [SNEK](https://www.snek.com/) on top-tier centralized exchanges, retail brokers, and trading platforms. This proposal is the **first-ever loan-based treasury withdrawal** in Cardano governance, introducing a new model of accountability where funds are not given as grants but repaid with interest.\n\nAs part of the governance process, a Board of Advisors will be appointed to ensure transparent execution and maximize ecosystem alignment. This board will include high-profile industry veterans like Tal Cohen (former CEO of Kraken), Phillip Pon (CEO of Emurgo), Fahmi Syed (President of Midnight Foundation), and Frederik Gregaard (CEO of Cardano Foundation), with additional top-tier names to be announced.\n\n*SNEK is the largest community token on Cardano, holding the highest market capitalization, over 42,000 wallets, and more than 2 billion ADA in all-time trading volume.*\n\nOver the past two years, the Snek Foundation has already invested over $5 million, entirely self-funded, to secure major exchange listings. Snek delivered the first, second, and third-ever Tier 1 listings for any Cardano native token, with Kraken, Crypto.com, and Kucoin, setting historic precedents for the ecosystem. With this proposal and with the support of our partners, we aim to unlock greater visibility, liquidity, and accessibility for the broader Cardano ecosystem by leveraging SNEK\u2019s proven momentum and market position.\n\nThis loan will be continuously repaid from Snek network activities, with a final balance plus interest settled after a closing audit in three to five years. Interest is set at 2.44% annualized (2.37% staking rate + 0.07%), compounded yearly.\n\nBy structuring this as a repayable loan, the Snek Foundation is once again trailblazing for the ecosystem; demonstrating how treasury capital can be deployed responsibly while setting a precedent for future projects.\n\nThis treasury withdrawal follows the approved Budget: \u20b35M Loan for Cardano's Global Listing Expansion - Powered by Snek ([gov_action1jr84r96lnsvu9yd6c0jhxe9gj5r7vnd2pgkntc6klplxdpyzz4tqqc9uldx](https://gov.tools/outcomes/governance_actions/90cf51975f9c19c291bac3e57364a89507e64daa0a2d35e356f87e6684821556#0)). The administrator of the budget funds will be Intersect, utilizing the treasury-contracts framework to manage funds.",
          "rationale": "### Executive summary\n\nThe SNEK Global Exchange Expansion initiative will execute a targeted listing strategy, using the requested 5M ada to:\n\n- Finalize negotiations and secure multiple top-tier listings on centralized exchanges, retail brokers, and innovative DeFi platforms\n\n- Provision liquidity and market making for ADA/SNEK pairs\n\n- Cover legal and compliance costs to meet exchange requirements\n\n- Fund mandatory coordination and announcement campaigns\n\n- Report expenditures and impact transparently to the community\n\n## Loan terms\n\n**Principal:** 5 million ada\n\n**Interest Rate:** 2.44% APR The loan will accrue interest at the current average Cardano staking rewards rate of 2.37% per year, plus an additional 0.07% as a gesture of good faith.\n\n**Repayment Timeline:** Repayments will be made continuously to the Cardano Treasury through multiple ways, including but not limited to: Snek network activities and direct payment from the Snek Foundation. Early payments may begin at any time. Principal repayment (without interest) must commence no later than the last day of year 3.\n\n**Audit & Review:** At the end of year 3, an independent audit will be conducted to review the repayments already made through Snek network activities revenues and contributions. The audit will verify the amounts reimbursed to date, calculate any outstanding principal and interest, and establish a repayment schedule to ensure the full balance is reimbursed over the remaining years.\n\n**Default & Enforcement:** In the unlikely event of non-repayment, the obligation will remain enforceable under the binding loan agreement administered by Intersect on behalf of the Treasury. Remedies and next steps would follow the terms of that contract.\n\n**Loan Maturity:** The full loan (principal + interest) must be repaid in full within 5 years from the date of disbursement.\n\n## Costs Breakdown\n\nWe heard and understand the feedback from several DReps requesting a detailed cost breakdown. However, certain elements of this initiative require discretion to preserve strategic leverage and protect the integrity of ongoing negotiations.\n\nA detailed cost breakdown has therefore been intentionally withheld to protect the strategic execution of this initiative.\n\nGiven the competitive and negotiation-sensitive nature of centralized exchange listings and liquidity operations, publicly disclosing specific allocations could:\n\n* Undermine our negotiation position with exchanges and service providers;  \n* Expose execution timing and scope to traders, increasing the risk of market frontrunning/manipulation;  \n* Limit our ability to adapt dynamically to changing conditions across venues.\n\nThe broader goal of this initiative remains unchanged: to expand Cardano\u2019s presence and address the underrepresentation of ADA-native tokens across external markets.\n\nWhile certain financial details cannot be shared in advance, the use of funds will still adhere strictly to the approved categories in this proposal and will be subject to independent audit and milestone-based review.\n\n## Administration of the loan\n\nThe administrator of the budget funds will be Intersect, offering continuous oversight. Expenditures will be tracked against the stated use of funds, with reporting, receipts, and independent audits ensuring that spending remains aligned with the proposal\u2019s objectives. This approach provides the flexibility required to execute global listings while still offering the Treasury transparent, phased accountability.\n\nA public version of the loan agreement between Intersect and the Snek Foundation will be made available if this Treasury Withdrawal action passes, with sensitive information redacted for security and privacy reasons. The current draft loan agreement can be found in References.\n\nAdditionally, a Board of Advisors will be appointed to provide guidance, feedback, and external validation.\n\n**The board will include:**\n\n- Tal Cohen, former CEO of Kraken  \n- Frederik Gregaard, CEO of Cardano Foundation  \n- Phillip Pon, CEO of Emurgo  \n- Fahmi Syed, President of Midnight Foundation  \n- Rapha C-Roy, CEO of Snek Foundation\n\n**The board\u2019s responsibilities:**\n\n- Advise key expenses  \n- Guide negotiations and legal strategy  \n- Ensure alignment with Cardano treasury goals  \n- Ensure outcomes benefit the Cardano ecosystem beyond SNEK  \n- Support documentation and distribution of listing playbooks to future Cardano-native token teams\n\nThis structure ensures that the project benefits from experienced external input while maintaining decentralized, community-led control over treasury execution.\n\nThe Board will also help facilitate knowledge sharing across the ecosystem by supporting documentation of listing procedures, exchange engagement strategy, and compliance best practices, enabling other Cardano native projects to benefit from this groundwork.\n\nAn allocation of 30-50k ada per year will be reserved out of the 5M for yearly independent external audit reports, ensuring that the loan is transparently monitored and fully accountable to the Treasury.\n\n### Loan Repayments\n\nThe loan is expected to be repaid over a five-year period, primarily through revenues generated across the Snek ecosystem.\n\n**Primary Source: Product and IP Revenues**  \nSnek Foundation generates revenues from a diversified portfolio of Web3 and Web2 products that together form the economic foundation of the Snek brand, including Snek.fun, SnekBot, SnekX, SNEK ENERGY, Snek Figures and future physical or digital product lines.\n\nAs an example, Snek.fun has, in prior periods, demonstrated the capacity to generate around \u20b3100,000  per month, averaging roughly \u20b33,000\u20133,500 per day. Even with no projected growth, that level of activity would represent more than \u20b36 million over five years, illustrating the repayment potential from a single product line. Ongoing cross-chain expansions, including Midnight and other networks, are expected to further strengthen this base.\n\nBeyond Snek.fun, the Snek Foundation manages a range of Web3 and Web2 initiatives that supplement revenues.\n\n**Treasury Strength**  \nThe Snek Treasury, currently valued at approximately \u20b310 million, provides an additional layer of repayment capacity and liquidity stability as ecosystem value grows.\n\n**Future Capital Raises**  \nAdditional capital inflows may also come from private or public equity rounds as the Snek ecosystem continues to expand.\n\n**Alternative sources**  \nNot to be excluded, fees generated through SNEK trading volume on partnered DEXs and CEX arbitrage could also be used as a repayment method. To date, the Snek Foundation has generated approximately \u20b31.2 million in trading fees.\n\nTaken together, these factors demonstrate a clear and sustainable path to repayment, supported by diversified revenue streams, appreciating treasury assets, and long-term ecosystem growth.\n\n#### Repayment Schedule\n\nA detailed repayment schedule has been intentionally withheld to protect the strategic execution of this initiative. Publicly disclosing exact repayment timing or structure could reveal sensitive information about the Foundation\u2019s revenue flows, commercial partnerships, and exchange operations; potentially exposing it to market speculation, counterparty leverage, or trading manipulation.\n\nThe loan will follow a five-year repayment framework, with the first repayment expected no later than the third year. Subsequent repayments will continue periodically until the full balance, including accrued interest, is repaid within the five-year term.\n\nRepayments will be made periodically, with interest accrued on the outstanding balance and payments applied first toward interest, then principal. The Snek Foundation also reserves the right to prepay any portion of the loan at any time without penalty, allowing acceleration of repayment if revenues exceed expectations.\n\nThis approach ensures the loan is repaid responsibly and transparently while maintaining the necessary confidentiality to execute effectively. Oversight will remain in place through milestone verification, reporting, and independent audit, ensuring accountability without compromising strategic flexibility.\n\n### Reporting\n\n#### Bi-Yearly Reports\n\nSnek Foundation will publish bi-yearly updates including:\n\n* Progress on exchange listings  \n* Funds spent with receipts when allowed  \n* All legal/compliance materials will be open-sourced when possible  \n* Learnings from legal, compliance, and integration processes  \n* Results of independent external audits  \n* Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)\n\n#### Success metrics\n\nTo demonstrate the success of the proposal over time, below is a preliminary, but not exhaustive, set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) covering exchange reach, liquidity, ecosystem impact, and repayment tracking:\n\n* Loan Utilization \u2014 % of funds spent  \n* Repayment Timeline \u2014 Amount of ADA repaid to the treasury over time  \n* Exchange Listings \u2014 Number of listings for SNEK  \n* Liquidity Growth \u2014 SNEK liquidity value on CEX order books and DEX pools  \n* Trading Volume Growth \u2014 SNEK daily average trading volume (CEX + DEX)  \n* On-chain Transaction Growth \u2014 SNEK daily average on-chain transaction\n\n#### Knowledge Sharing\n\nAll listing playbooks, integration frameworks, and documentation will be made available to the Cardano Foundation, Emurgo, IOG, and future token teams.\n\nWe will also collaborate with the Cardano Foundation to ensure effective knowledge transfer from this initiative, supporting future ecosystem efforts while staying within contractual and confidentiality boundaries.\n\nProgress will continue to be shared during Cardano town halls and across governance channels to maintain transparency and feedback loops.\n\n## Budget Administration\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract has been drafted between the Snek Foundation and Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), administered by Intersect, detailing delivery schedules, milestones, and dispute resolution processes. This Legal Contract will be confirmed and signed by the authorized persons if the Treasury Withdrawal is successful. More details can be found in the References.\n\n### Project Delivery\n\nMilestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts, and timelines will be agreed upon between Intersect and the Snek Foundation. The Snek Foundation will deliver according to the Legal Contract, with milestone completion attested by the Snek Foundation and verified by Intersect or a 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nIntersect\u2019s delivery assurance function will monitor progress and communicate status to the community. A 3rd Party Assurer will review and sign off on milestone deliverables before payments are released.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nIntersect will use the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs, audited by TxPipe and MLabs. Funds will be held in a Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC) and disbursed to Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSCs) as milestones are met.\n\nThe Oversight Committee \u2014 consisting of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus, and NMKR \u2014 will verify key administrative actions on-chain.\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will reuse the infrastructure used for the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget. The same Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), will be used. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles.\n\nAn Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee\u2019s role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration, please see the [Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration) on the knowledge base.\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. The logic of the TRSC and PSSC prevent them from delegating to SPOs, only allowing delegation to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. Thus funds held in administration by these contracts will be delegated to auto-abstain predefined DRep.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the Snek Foundation is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard is available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain. Please see [cardanotreasury.fi](http://cardanotreasury.fi).\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV sections 4 and 5.",
          "motivation": "## Who we are\n\nSnek Foundation is a grassroots organization responsible for launching and maintaining the SNEK ecosystem. Snek has never raised external funds for exchange listings and has operated for the past 31 months, entirely self-funded through its revenue and treasury.\n\nSo far, more than $5 million has been invested by the Snek Foundation towards listing activities.\n\n**Since May 2023, Snek has:**\n\n- 42,000+ wallets holding SNEK \u2014 the most actively held token on Cardano  \n- 2,000,000,000 ADA in all-time trading volume \u2014 the most traded token on Cardano  \n- SNEK is the most well-known token in and out of the Cardano ecosystem, with 30 markets  \n- Self-funded $5M for exchange listing activities  \n- Delivered the three first-ever Tier 1 exchange listings for Cardano via Kraken, Crypto.com, and Kucoin.  \n- Developed the first-ever CEX-DEX market-making service with Flowdesk  \n- Launched Snek.fun, Cardano\u2019s leading launchpad, driving over 30% of all chain trades since inception  \n- Trademarked brand with ongoing IP licensing deals (Snek Figures, Snek Energy)\n\nThe team has a successful track record negotiating listings, building tools, and driving global meme adoption aligned with Cardano\u2019s values.\n\n## Why this proposal matters\n\nSNEK is Cardano\u2019s most adopted token, yet it remains underrepresented on major centralized exchanges, reflecting a broader lack of visibility for Cardano on mainstream platforms and among broader audiences.\n\nThis underrepresentation doesn\u2019t just affect SNEK. It weakens Cardano\u2019s position in competitive markets and slows ecosystem-wide growth in four key areas:\n\n1. ADA\u2019s visibility and liquidity on global platforms  \n2. Cardano\u2019s competitiveness in retail-driven market cycles  \n3. The discoverability of Cardano\u2019s ecosystem by mainstream users  \n4. CNT adoption and the path for other tokens to reach similar success\n\nCardano currently lacks a flagship token that drives liquidity, virality, and culture across exchange listings, just like DOGE, SHIBA, and PEPE do for Ethereum and Solana.  \nSNEK has already shown it can fill this role; now it needs support to break through at scale.\n\n**This proposal aims to address the following challenges:**\n\n- **Lack of exchange presence for Cardano native tokens:** Most major centralized exchanges and retail brokers still do not support Cardano Native Tokens (CNTs). This severely limits Cardano\u2019s accessibility and competitiveness on a global scale. While Ethereum and Solana ecosystems enjoy deep integrations with top exchanges, Cardano-native projects are left with fewer liquidity pathways and less discoverability. Until CNTs are more visible on mainstream platforms, Cardano\u2019s on-chain economy cannot reach its full potential.\n\n- **Low visibility for ADA pairings:** Centralized exchanges are the primary entry point for millions of users, yet ADA trading pairs are underrepresented relative to Cardano\u2019s market cap. Without community-driven assets like SNEK creating demand for ADA pairings, liquidity remains shallow and volume muted. This proposal helps bootstrap those pairings, supporting deeper ADA liquidity and reinforcing Cardano\u2019s relevance at the trading layer.\n\n- **Missed user acquisition:** In other ecosystems, memecoins like SHIB, DOGE, and PEPE have served as cultural gateways for millions of new retail users. These tokens create stories, engagement, and participation, driving demand for the base layer tokens and ecosystem tools. SNEK has proven it can play that role for Cardano. Without support to elevate its accessibility, Cardano risks missing this powerful user acquisition funnel.\n\n- **Liquidity fragmentation:** Cardano\u2019s DeFi protocols face high barriers to liquidity aggregation due to the lack of bridgeable, on-ramp-compatible assets. Without listings on major exchanges, Cardano native assets remain siloed and isolated from the broader crypto capital flows, limiting scalability and adoption.\n\nBy funding this initiative, Cardano positions itself to solve these bottlenecks through a trusted, culturally strong and community-proven asset that can serve as a gateway for users and liquidity.\n\nToday, Snek is the only Cardano-native token capable of meeting Tier 1 exchange requirements. This makes it the best and currently only viable gateway to unlock the access, liquidity, and visibility Cardano needs at the global level.\n\nThe goal is not exclusivity \u2014 it\u2019s scalability. By leading the way through Snek, we create a repeatable path for other CNTs to follow. The foundation has already begun sharing its knowledge with other projects post-Kraken, and through this proposal, will continue building and systematizing resources that can be shared with Cardano Foundation, Emurgo, and IOG.",

Beyond that, being able to buy .ada and .cardano domains (such as such as .org or .xyz) will allow the Cardano ecosystem to leverage them for innovations as well as bridge the Web2 to Web3 divide.",

          "rationale": "### Executive Summary\n\nWhile Cardano offers an on-chain mechanism to compensate Stake Pool Operators (SPOs) for their work and Delegate Representatives (DReps) may be compensated by Ada holders (Article V, Section 5), the Constitutional Committee (CC) is \u201climited to voting on the constitutionality of governance actions\u201d (Article VII, Section 1) regardless of personal preference or community sentiment. Carrying out this mandate requires careful review of governance actions, familiarity with the Constitution and governance mechanisms, and the capacity to act impartially. CC members also face significant administrative costs in performing these duties, including research, deliberation, drafting, and participation in cross-time-zone meetings.\n\nWithout compensation from a neutral source, participation risks being limited to those able to subsidize these costs themselves or they may be subsidized by another institution. This could result in an \u201civory tower\u201d where only the wealthy or well-connected are able to serve. Establishing a reasonable budget for compensation from the Cardano Treasury ensures that service in the CC accessible to a broad range of qualified contributors and the institution itself remains distinct and independent.\n\n### Participating Members\n\nThis governance action was built from discussion between the seven currently serving members of the CC and will provide for the compensation of five of these members.\n\nThe members seeking compensation are:\n\nCardano Atlantic Council, script-hash-349e55f83e9af24813e6cb368df6a80d38951b2a334dfcdf26815558\nTingvard, script-hash-1980dbf1ad624b0cb5410359b5ab14d008561994a6c2b6c53fabec00\nEastern Cardano Council, script-hash-84aebcfd3e00d0f87af918fc4b5e00135f407e379893df7e7d392c6a\nAce Alliance, script-hash-9752e4306e5ae864441d21064f791174c8b626199b8e7a45f9e03b45\nCardano Japan Council, script-hash-9cc3f387623f45dae6a68b7096b0c2e403d8601a82dc40221ead41e2\n\nThe members not seeking compensation are:\n\nKtorZ, key-hash-dc0d6ef49590eb6880a50a00adde17596e6d76f7159572fa1ff85f2a\nPhil_uplc, key-hash-13493790d9b03483a1e1e684ea4faf1ee48a58f402574e7f2246f4d4\n\n### Budget\n\nThe total amount of this budget shall be 1,000,000 Ada.\n\nEach of the five members seeking compensation shall be allowed to request up to 200,000 Ada as part of a single Treasury Withdrawal pursuant to the budget.\n\n### Administrator\n\nThe Administrator of this budget shall be a customized version of the open source Cardano Treasury/Vendor Smart Contract developed by Intersect & Sundae Labs. This Smart Contract will be deployed with the following conditions:\n\n#### Funding Method\n\n* A separate smart contract instance will be deployed for each CC member to ensure individualized oversight and accounting.\n* These five smart contract instances will be concurrently funded subject to the passage of a Treasury Withdrawal Governance Action specifying the amount that each contract is due to receive.\n* The Treasury Withdrawal Governance Action must be approved for submission by all members seeking compensation.\n\n#### Withdrawal Logic\n\n* The designated CC member may withdraw funds from the smart contract to an account in their custody once every six epochs.\n* Each withdrawal equals the proportionate share of their service time in the 73-epoch funding term (i.e., pro-rata vesting based on actual service).\n* Assets in the smart contract will only be able to be sent to the CC member account specified upon launch or the Cardano Treasury.\n\n#### Oversight & Audit Mechanism\n\n* Each CC member\u2019s smart contract will be overseen and auditable by the other four CC members.\n* The other four CC members collectively hold the authority to pause further withdrawals if the designated member is no longer serving in their CC role.\n* There will be no capability in the smart contract to change the recipient of funds. If the CC member wishes to receive compensation to another account for some reason (i.e. they lost access to their original account) they will need to make a new budget request to Ada holders.\n\n#### Expiration & Fund Recovery\n\n* Any funds remaining in the contract six epochs after the close of the 73-epoch funding term will be swept back into the Cardano Treasury, ensuring no stranded or unclaimed funds persist indefinitely.\n\n### Dispute Resolution\n\nDispute resolution under this framework is handled directly by the smart contract through a vote of the four Constitutional Committee members overseeing each smart contract instance. If concerns arise regarding a designated member\u2019s eligibility or continued service, the remaining CC members may cast votes within the contract to determine whether withdrawals should be paused or allowed to continue. A defined majority threshold ensures that no single member can unilaterally block or reinstate payments, while still allowing the CC itself to resolve disputes internally without requiring an external institution.\n\n### Reporting\n\nCC members will be expected to provide a public address, controlled by the individual or entity receiving funds, at the time they submit a Treasury Withdrawal Governance Action. This ensures transparency and accountability, as Ada holders will be able to independently review and verify each withdrawal by tracing transactions from the smart contract to the designated CC member\u2019s custodied account using any blockchain explorer.\n\nIf it becomes necessary to freeze a contract and suspend withdrawals, that action and its justification must be publicly reported by the CC members voting to take such action. This will ensure that the community is aware of any exceptional circumstances.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, this framework provides a balanced approach to compensating Constitutional Committee members in a manner that is transparent, accountable, and aligned with Cardano\u2019s governance principles. By leveraging smart contracts to automate withdrawals, enforce vesting schedules, and allow peer oversight with the ability to pause payments, the system ensures both fairness to participants and protection of community resources. The requirement for public reporting of custodied addresses and withdrawal records further reinforces trust, while the automatic return of unclaimed funds to the Treasury safeguards against waste.\n\nMost importantly, this model allows the CC to operate as an independent institution, free from undue influence or reliance on outside funding sources, thereby strengthening its ability to exercise impartial judgment in overseeing constitutional governance.\n\n## References",

          "rationale": "# I.Simple summary of the changes and their rationale from Cardano Constitution v1.0 to v2.3\n\n## 1. Items Removed from Constitution v1.0\n\n### (a) Expectations and Encouragement clauses\n\nExpectations: ARTICLE III. Section 6 (off-chain governance management), ARTICLE V. Section 3 (DRep code of conduct), ARTICLE V. Section 4 (DRep selection tool), ARTICLE VII. Section 1 (CC expertise), ARTICLE VII. Section 7 (CC tool support)\n\nEncouragement: ARTICLE VI. Section 3 (SPO code of conduct), ARTICLE VIII. Section 1 (constitutional discussion)\n\nRationale: These provisions were aspirational or advisory in nature (expectations/encouragements), not enforceable constitutional rules.\n\n### (b) Budget Info Action Provisions (ARTICLE III. Section 4, ARTICLE IV, ARTICLE VII. Section 4)\n\nRationale: The Budget Info Action mechanism was removed to simplify governance. Its requirements have been absorbed into Treasury Withdrawal Governance Actions.\n\n### \\(c\\) Obligation to Create a CC Code of Conduct (ARTICLE VII. Section 6)\n\nRationale: This was considered an operational detail better left to community practice rather than a constitutional mandate. The CC may still adopt codes of conduct, but it is no longer a constitutional requirement.\n\n## 2. Changes and additions (excluding deletions)\n\n### (a) Overall - Fixed typos, simplified wording, and unified terminology.\n\nRationale: Improves readability and ensures consistency\n\n### (b) Defined Terms: - Added definitions such as Active Voting Stake, Ada Holders, DRep, SPO, Net Change Limit, Treasury Withdrawal Recipient.\n\nRationale: Eliminates ambiguity and ensures consistency in interpretation\n\n### \\(c\\) ARTICLE II, Section 6 \u2013 Introduced requirement that \u201cThe document hosted by such a URL shall be immutable.\u201d\n\nRationale: ensure proposals cannot be altered after submission, protecting integrity and trust\n\n### (d) ARTICLE II Section 7 :Reassigned conditions previously tied to the Budget Info Action, making them mandatory at the time of Treasury Withdrawals after its removal\n\nRationale: strengthen accountability and transparency in the use of Treasury funds and preserve oversight and audit safeguards after removing the Budget Info Action mechanism\n\n# II.Simple summary of changes and reasons from Cardano Constitution v2.0 to v2.3\n\n## 1. Editorial & Structural Improvements\n\n* Terminology: Standardized terms like \u201cCardano Community Member\u201d, \u201cAda Holders\u201d.\n* Definitions: Definitions: Clarified the \u201cNet Change Limit\u201d (maximum treasury withdrawal per period) and refined the definition of \u201cStake Pool Operator\u201d (the entity controlling cold keys).\n\n## 2. Section-Specific Revisions\n\n* ARTICLE II Section 1: Clarifies no formal membership is needed to use or benefit from Cardano.\n* ARTICLE II Section 5: Simplifies redundant provisions regarding SPOs.\n* ARTICLE II Section 6: Simplification of wording in some provisions.\n* ARTICLE II Section 7: (1) Removed: The requirement to include the \u201clocation and identity of the recipient\u201d in withdrawal terms, the explicit requirement to budget for audit costs, and the explicit statement that \u201cwithdrawals shall be used for the purpose set out in paragraph 1\u201d (2) Changed: The special requirements that previously applied only to withdrawals exceeding 1,000,000 ADA in a two-year period (i.e., appointing independent auditors and publishing annual reports, designating administrators to oversee funds, and keeping funds in auditable separate accounts delegated to abstain) now apply as general requirements for all withdrawals.\n* TREASURY-04a (x): Deletes requirement for treasury withdrawal roadmaps to be approved via Info Action.\n\n# III.Evidence of widespread community reviews:\n\nConstitution v2.0 received review and voting by 86.23% of total DRep voting power, including both Yes/No/Abstain votes.\nMany DReps submitted detailed analyses publicly.\nv2.3 builds on v2.0 with rational improvements and direct incorporation of on-chain feedback.\nConcerns regarding insufficient discussion of the constitution have been reasonably addressed in v2.3.",
          "motivation": "# The proposed changes aim to:\n1. Simplify governance by removing non-binding expectations and redundant mechanisms like Budget Info Action.\n2. Improve clarity and consistency through unified terminology, added definitions, and streamlined provisions.\n3. Strengthen accountability by applying treasury audit safeguards universally and ensuring proposal documents remain immutable.\n\nPlease see the \"Rationale\" section for details.",

          "abstract": "This Treasury Withdrawal funds **12 months** of full active maintenance and development for GovTool, the open-source, community-owned set of governance tools that form Cardano\u2019s core low-barrier platform for participation in on-chain governance.\n\nGovTool enables ada holders to register, delegate, propose, vote, and transparently view outcomes. It is actively maintained and expanded by the Cardano GovTool Consortium which consists of ByronNetwork, WeDeliver, LidoNation and Dquadrant with additional open source contributors, guided by the Governance Tools Working Group.\n\nFunding will ensure operational stability, incentivisation for community contributions, support for other open source governance tools using GovTool open-source code and APIs, and deliver accelerated functional updates across all governance pillars. Any unused funds will be returned to the Cardano Treasury.\n\nThis withdrawal follows the approved budget Info Action for \u20b31.15M (gov_action1n5sn54mgf47a7men2ryq6ppx88kta4wvenz2qkl4f9v6ppje8easqxwm88m) and it will be administered by Intersect via smart contract framework, fulfilling the constitutional requirement to detail the proposed solution, its alignment to the approved budget, and the amount to be withdrawn.",
          "rationale": "### **Project Solution**\n\nAs approved in the Budget Info action, the funding will deliver:\n\nHosting, infrastructure maintenance, CI-CD, security, and minimum maintenance of\n\n* $5k / \u20b36.25k per month for hosting costs (further detailed breakdown [here](https://docs.gov.tools/important-updates/govtool-maintenance-ending-soon/updated-budget-proposal/budget-proposal-faqs#whats-included-in-the-usd5000-per-month-for-hosting)) including Dev, QA environments for the dev of each of the pillars and Preview, PreProd and Mainnet production environments  \n* $30k / \u20b337.5k (0.25 FTE) for 12 months of infrastructure maintenance\n\nIncentives for contributors\n\n* \u20b3150,000 to be allocated organically via direct contribution on the repos  \n* \u20b3100,000 to be allocated to other open source governance tools that provide new and better ways to participate in Cardano Governance leveraging (and where possible expanding) GovTool code or GovTool APIs  \n* Note: it is planned to utilize the [Andamio platform](https://www.andamio.io/) to transparently distribute incentives to contributors\n\nActive development and maintenance of all pillars\n\n* Overall end-to-end testing $120k / \u20b3150k (1 FTE)  \n* Proposal Pillar $120k / \u20b3150k (1 FTE)  \n* Delegation Pillar $180k / \u20b3225k (1.5 FTE)  \n* Voting Pillar $180k / \u20b3225k (1.5 FTE)  \n* Outcomes Pillar $90k / \u20b3122.5k (0.75 FTE)  \n* Budget discussion Pillar $60k / \u20b375k (0.5 FTE)\n\nThis was budgeted based upon the ADA-USD value of 0.8. Any unused funds will be returned to the Cardano Treasury.\n\n#### Active Development - Roadmap\n\nBecause GovTool's roadmap is directly defined by the Cardano community, so subject to change and evolution. The best place to check what's coming next is the community backlog [Governance Tools Community Backlog](https://github.com/orgs/IntersectMBO/projects/34/views/1) and the community discussion (recently started to make it easier to define direction) [GovTool discussions](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/govtool/discussions). \n\nHowever there are some key initiatives that already have clear community support and that this proposal commits to deliver (full details can be seen in the [shared GovTool roadmap](https://docs.gov.tools/important-updates/govtool-maintenance-ending-soon/updated-budget-proposal/proposed-roadmap)). High-level details below (the initiatives are in order of readiness for development):\n\n* Add support to **create and operate group (script-based) DReps**, this will enable smaller DReps to easily come together and build strong coalitions so further distributing voting power.  \n* **DRep history on the DRep page** to show what that DRep voted on, how and (if available) with what rationale, also show the delegations moving in and out. All this will provide better context to the delegator, also opening new options to sort and filter DReps so supporting liquid democracy.  \n* **DRep voting history on Governance Actions** to allow DReps and Ada holders to see directly on the Governance Action page, alongside all the context coming from the metadata, the details related to voting, making it easier also to see if their DRep voted as they expected, thus enabling liquid democracy.  \n* **Ability to submit more than one vote in one transaction**  \n* **Constitutional Committee details on Governance Actions** (both those up for voting and those that have been ratified or rejected). This will make it easier to see which constitutional committee voted on a specific Governance Action and why they voted in that way, all on the same page.  \n* **Add support for group proposers** to foster the creation of more governance actions, provide more clarity on-chain about where the proposal comes from  \n* **Integration with CoSponsor** to allow authors to crowdfund the cost of the Governance Action deposit, hence lowering the barrier for participation to the global community  \n* Add an **easier way for delegators to identify DReps** by helping find DReps that have voting history aligned with delegators voting principles.  \n* **Further expand open APIs coverage** to include access to submission for all types of governance actions. This will make it easier for other builders to include this critical feature faster, dramatically lowering the barriers to submit a governance action.  \n* Generally **expand options for individual contributions to the open source code**. Specifically integrate the GitHub backlog with the Andamio platform to allow anyone to get onboarded to the repos and be rewarded for meaningful contributions to key identified issues  \n* **Optimise the hosting and deployment infrastructure** to reduce cost and make general maintenance more efficient\n\n#### Governance\n\nThe Governance Tools working group in Intersect, is responsible for coordinating efforts related to governance tooling in general, hosting discussions about current and future needs. Over the past 18 months, the working group focused on channeling community direction for the GovTool project. Going forward the working group, on top of supporting broader discussions across tools, will continue supporting the newly formed GovTool consortium, acting also the meeting space for it when useful.\n\nThe GovTool Consortium, open to any contributor who actively joins the discussions, will keep collecting input and feedback from the users and owners of GovTool (Cardano Community) and shape the roadmap direction. This will also act as the coordinator to transparently allocate and distribute the incentives of this budget to individual contributors by leveraging the Andamio platform. In the short-term, this group will also help facilitate the open process to award to a builder the hosting and infrastructure maintenance role described in this budget.\n\n#### Vendor Profiles\n\nThe **Cardano GovTool Consortium** is made of all the builders currently actively working on the development of GovTool, the builders of tools who leverage GovTool APIs and code, and anyone who actively participates in the Governance tools working group. The following builders who are submitting this governance action are leading the Consortium effort:\n\n* [**LidoNation**](https://www.lidonation.com/en) - Outcomes pillar  \n* [**ByronNetwork**](https://byron.network) - Delegation & Voting pillars  \n* [**WeDeliver**](https://we-deliver.io/) - Proposal Discussion & Budget Proposals pillars  \n* [**Dquadrant**](https://dquadrant.com/) - End-to-end testing\n\nThese teams have been building governance tools since before CIP-1694, through SanchoNet GovTool, Voltaire GovTool, and the Chang&Plomin upgrades. All code is open-source and maintained in public repositories, with contributions from a global community of developers.\n\n#### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between each member of the GovTool consortium (vendor) and Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), administered by Intersect, detailing delivery schedules, milestones, and dispute resolution processes.\n\n#### Project Delivery\n\nMilestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts, and timelines will be agreed upon between Intersect and the vendors. Vendors will deliver according to the Legal Contract, with milestone completion attested by the vendors and verified by Intersect or a 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nIntersect\u2019s delivery assurance function will monitor progress and communicate status to the community. A 3rd Party Assurer will review and sign off on milestone deliverables before payments are released.\n\n#### Budget Management Tooling\n\nIntersect will use the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs, audited by TxPipe and MLabs. Funds will be held in a Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC) and disbursed to Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSCs) as milestones are met.\n\nThe Oversight Committee \u2014 consisting of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus, and NMKR \u2014 will verify key administrative actions on-chain.\n\nNote: Dquadrant is present within the Oversight Committee and as a builder within the GovTools Consortium, they will abstain from any oversight of GovTool-related contracts.\n\nA public dashboard ([cardanotreasury.fi](http://cardanotreasury.fi)) will allow the community to audit fund flows, track milestones, and verify spending immutably on-chain.\n\n##### Specifics\n\nIntersect will reuse the infrastructure used for the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget. The same Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), will be used. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. A Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Xerberus, Dquadrant and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration, please see the [Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration) on the knowledge base.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n* TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify  \n  * Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-offs must authorize  \n* TRSC Disperse  \n  * Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize  \n* TRSC Pause and Resume  \n  * Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize  \n* TRSC Sweep  \n  * One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize  \n* TRSC Reorganize  \n  * Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n##### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. The logic of the TRSC and PSSC prevent them from delegating to SPOs, only allowing delegation to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. Thus funds held in administration by these contracts will be delegated to auto-abstain predefined DRep.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard is available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain. Please see [cardanotreasury.fi](http://cardanotreasury.fi).\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV sections 4 and 5.\n\n### References",
          "motivation": "This proposal addresses the risk of governance participation becoming fragmented or dependent on closed-sourced, privately-owned, commercialised tools. In Cardano\u2019s Voltaire era, without an open, neutral, and accessible platform like GovTool, Cardano\u2019s decentralisation and legitimacy would be weakened.\n\nGovTool is already widely used:\n\n* 50,000+ unique mainnet users across 170+ countries (metrics via [analytics.gov.tools](https://analytics.gov.tools/))  \n* Three networks supported  \n* Thousands of governance transactions  \n* Integration with ecosystem tools (1694.io, cardanobudget.com, tempo.vote, Governancespace.com, budget.cardano.africa, 1694.tools, and others)\n\nFunding will preserve and expand this infrastructure, sustain its open source nature, and ensure it continues to serve as a public good underpinning Cardano governance. Furthermore, it will onboard more individual contributors making maintenance more distributed and efficient going forward.\n\n* [GovTool repository (voting and delegation pillars)](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/govtool/)  \n* [Proposal Pillar repository](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/govtool-proposal-pillar)  \n* [Outcomes Pillar repository](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/govtool-outcomes-pillar)",

          "abstract": "The primary goal of this budget proposal is to increase liquidity on Cardano, specifically by supporting stablecoin liquidity. The secondary goal is to generate revenue for the treasury. 50,000,000 ADA is requested to create a fund composed of ADA and fiat backed stablecoins to support the Cardano decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. The majority of the funds (99%) in this budget will be disbursed to DeFi protocols including decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and lending protocols to help seed liquidity on Cardano. Funds must only contain ADA, fiat backed stablecoins, and liquidity tokens from deployment into DeFi protocols. The funds will be managed from a smart contract administered by a 9 person interim committee composed of publicly identified individuals with oversight from a newly established treasury DAO (tDAO), where membership in the treasury DAO includes decentralized representatives (dReps). After 1 year, the tDAO will be required to elect a new committee or else no actions can be taken. The tDAO has the oversight abilities to impeach, elect, and ultimately shut down the fund and return funds to the treasury. In addition to the fund, this proposal will establish a number of public goods including a legal framework for future community involved proposals like this as well as an open source governance contract with executive and oversight functionality.",
          "rationale": "### Administration\n\nThe fund will be administered by a smart contract with features defined in the Smart Contract document that can be found in the supplemental links. This section briefly describes the features and concepts, but the supplemental document fully defines the smart contract used to administer funds.\n\nThe smart contract used to administer funds will have two bodies: (1) a committee that performs executive functions and (2) a treasury decentralized autonomous organization (tDAO) composed of registered dReps that perform an oversight function.\n\nMembers of the administrating committee will have a start and end date for which their signatures will be valid. Funds in the smart contract can be used with a majority of signatures, and can be used for depositing liquidity into DEX and lending protocols or transferring funds to third parties for liquidation and stablecoin minting. Committee members may also remove or impeach other members (remove keys) to remove their ability to sign for the contract. This is a  security mechanism, for example if signing keys are exposed. Committee members may not add new members, and if a member is removed then the only way to add them back is through tDAO election.\n\nThe tDAO performs oversight functions on the smart contract, holding the administrating committee accountable. They can vote to turn off administrating committee actions, preventing the committee from performing any action except returning funds back to the treasury. The tDAO can both remove and elect new committee members, where elections consist of adding a new key to the contract that is tied to a start and end date (defining the term of the committee members service). All tDAO actions require a 51% majority of dReps to vote, with a 25% quorum.\n\n### Legal Structure\n\nCardano has been the leader in blockchain decentralization, and has the first and largest fully decentralized, community governed treasury. This requires legal structures to protect both the fund, dReps as members of the tDAO, and members of the committee. One or more legal entities will be created to support the fund. Legal structure is needed to give members of the committee and the tDAO standing and representation in court to protect and defend the funds. Legal structures to fully support the fund, the committee, and the tDAO will be proposed to the community and the final legal structure and costs will be included in the first withdrawal request. Jurisdictions under consideration are the Cayman Islands, British Virgin Islands, Marshall Islands and Switzerland. The United States may also be considered given the Wyoming decentralized unincorporated nonprofit association (DUNA).\n\nIt is important for legal reasons that the primary goal of the fund is to increase the depth of liquidity in the Cardano DeFi ecosystem, and the purpose of the committee is to manage treasury funds with oversight from dReps. The majority of any interest gained (85%) will be left in DeFi protocols to grow, with a small portion (15%) being sent back to the treasury. Thus, the committee is managing treasury assets for the public good of Cardano rather than operating an investment fund. This is analogous to the structures of other DAOs like Aave and Uniswap.\n\nThe legal structure will be clearly outlined and described in the first withdrawal action, with complete costs and timeline. The legal structure must be in place prior to the second withdrawal action. See the timeline section for more information on the withdrawal information.\n\n### Withdrawals and Budget\n\n#### Summary (Total Withdrawals  50,000,000 ADA)\n\nWithdrawal 1 (500,000 ADA max)\n\n* Amaru smart contract setup (25,000 ADA)  \n* Smart contract and UI development (200,000 ADA)  \n* Smart contract audit (75,000 ADA)  \n* Legal fees (200,000 ADA)\n\nWithdrawal 2 (49,500,000 ADA)\n\n* ADA liquidation and stablecoin mint cost (500,000 ADA)  \n* Liquidity deployment (49,000,000)\n\n#### Withdrawal 1  Max 500,000 ADA\n\nAll fees are maximum estimates, and exact costs, providers, and implementation plans will be included in the first withdrawal action. If some costs are less than expected and others more expensive, costs for specific items will be adjusted but the total for the first withdrawal action will not total more than 500,000 ADA. Any amount less than 500,000 ADA will be passed to the second withdrawal action and used to deploy into DeFi protocols. If there are any funds remaining at the conclusion of work, they must be returned to the treasury and the residual amount may be included in the second withdrawal action.\n\nThe first withdrawal will be made to an Amaru contract setup to pay for smart contract development, auditing, and payment of legal fees. The Amaru team will be paid to setup and provide support for any issues that might arise for the duration of the work.\n\nEither prior or after submission of the info action, RFPs will be sent to legal institutions for establishment of legal structures. The committee will evaluate initial responses and invite the best candidates to make final revisions that will be released for public comment and evaluation. The committee will review the merits of the final candidates along with public feedback to make a final decision that will be included in the first withdrawal. **The first withdrawal action must include the name of the institution, exact cost, and plan for establishment of legal structure for the treasury fund.**\n\nOnce this budget info action is approved, the committee will accept proposals for development of the smart contract and UI and proposals for smart contract auditors. It is possible for one team or organization to submit proposals for both smart contract development and auditing, but the same team cannot perform both development and auditing. Smart contracts and UI will be made fully open source, allowing similar initiatives to use the contracts. The specific development teams, implementation and coordination plan, and specific costs will be included in the first withdrawal action.\n\n#### Withdrawal 2  49,500,000 ADA\n\nThe legal structure for the fund must be established prior to submission of this withdrawal. Withdrawal of funds must be made to the administrating contract.\n\nOn successful passing of Withdrawal 2, the committee will request proposals from OTC desks and other suitable institutions that can liquidate ADA for dollars and mint stablecoins. Institutions should handle both liquidation of ADA and minting stablecoins. The committee will make public the most promising candidates and fees to receive public feedback, and the institution selected by the committee MUST be included in the second withdrawal. Exact costs for liquidation and minting as well as timeline must be included in the proposal.\n\nOn successful passing of Withdrawal 1, the committee will publicly request proposals from DEX and lending protocols to receive funds. Specific proposal criteria will be included in the RFP, but will require information on commitment to DeFi ethos, yield projections, and plans for attracting additional liquidity. Details for how the committee should make selections are detailed in the Governance Protocol in the supplemental links. The selected protocols and exact amounts sent to each protocol MUST be included in the second withdrawal.\n\n### People\n\nBelow are the 9 members of the interim administrating committee. They range in experience and background to help ensure the long term success and sustainability of the stablecoin liquidity. Additional info is included in the Interim Committee document in the supplemental links.\n\n1. Linda Roland (aka CryptoFly)  \n2. Darren Camas (IPOR Labs)  \n3. Nick Schaub, Ph.D. (aka Elder Millenial)  \n4. Giorgio Zinetti (Cardano Foundation)  \n5. Massimo Morini, Ph.D.  \n6. Darlington Wleh (Lido Nation)  \n7. Murasaki (EMURGO)  \n8. Raphael Christian-Roy (Snek Foundation)  \n9. Ryan Davis  (IOHK)\n\n### Constitutionality of the Budget\n\n**Purpose**: This proposal is for work intended to enhance the long term sustainability of Cardano by increasing stablecoin liquidity in the ecosystem.\n\n**Article III(5)**: This proposal fulfills this section of the Cardano Constitution by containing a Title, Abstract, Reason for Proposal (Motivation and Rationale), and Supporting Materials. An off-chain copy of this proposal is linked to as the last element of the Supporting Materials section and is a Github link with commit hash thus fulfilling the other requirement of this section to have an off-chain copy with document hash. The Supporting Materials is not included in Github version of the document since it contains the commit hash.\n\n**Article IV(1)**: We propose that this budget span 73 epochs (roughly 1 calendar year). This proposal does setup a framework for perpetual investment in Cardano, but the withdrawals must be completed within 1 year.\n\n**Article IV(2)**: Disbursements for this budget must be made to a smart contract composed of 9 independent administrating members with at 5 of 9 signing policy for spending funds along with community oversight mechanisms from dReps. The process of overseeing funds then requires 5 of the 9 independent administrating members agree to disbursement of funds to DeFi protocols. The smart contract must be the owner of any liquidity deposited into DeFi protocols, meaning liquidity tokens or any other assurance of liquidity must be held in the multisig wallet and should not be delegated to a third party. With this design, the committee will be the administrator of the budget and will directly oversee distribution of funds to protocols, with dReps having and oversight function that permits shutting the fund down and returning back to the treasury.\n\n**Article IV(3)**: At the time of submission, the NCL is currently at 350 million ADA and there are less than 300 million ADA in approved budgets. We believe that this removes a potential constitutional barrier for this proposal based on Article IV(3), since this proposal requests 50 million ADA.\n\n**Article IV(4)**: We budget 275,000 ADA for construction of a smart contract and appropriate audits for the smart contract used to administer funds. The nature of the proposal requires liquidity to be held in the contract in order to make auditing by the community easy, since a single address will hold the total liquidity of the fund. Since the fund is designed to exist in perpetuity (with safeguards to shut down the fund through community action), specific budget to audit the fund are not specifically included but can be proposed and approved by the community and paid by the revenue of the fund.\n\n**Article IV Section 5**: The nature of the proposed work fulfills the first requirement of Article IV(5) of the constitution. The holding of all assets in the smart contract composed of 9 independent signers improves the ability of the Cardano community to easily audit and track actions taken by the committee. To fulfill the second part of the section, funds will not be delegated to an SPO and will be delegated to the predefined auto-abstain voting option.\n\n**TREASURY-04a**: There is no on chain withdrawal action for this budget, and one will not be submitted unless this budget achieves the necessary approval.",
          "motivation": "### Overview\n\n* **Amount** 50 million ADA is requested for a budget period of 12 months. Up to 500,000 ADA will be used to establish a legal framework for the fund and create a smart contract with executive and oversight functions. The remaining 49.5 million ADA will be dedicated to funding Cardano DeFi protocols. Up to 35% of the fund will remain in ADA to pair with stablecoins on DEXs, and the remainder will be dedicated to minting stablecoins.  \n* **Administration**  The fund will be administered in a smart contract with a 9 person committee that will require 5 signatures to spend funds. The tDAO (made up of a broad snapshot of dReps) will have oversight functions including the ability to impeach and elect committee members as well as temporarily or permanently prevent spend actions other than sending funds back to the treasury. The administrating committee will be responsible for working with 3rd party exchanges or trading desks to convert ADA to fiat backed stablecoins and then deploying to defi protocols (i.e. DEX and lending protocols).   \n* **Revenue**  Funds deployed in DeFi protocols will earn revenue, and once a month 15% of revenue will be converted to ADA and sent back to the treasury while 85% will remain in protocols to continue growing. ADA held by the committee that is not deployed will not be staked according to constitutional requirements (see Rationale for more information).  \n* **Deployment**  DeFi protocols may apply to be recipients of stablecoin liquidity, and the administrating committee will review and disburse funds to protocols that have the best plans for growth and returns back to the treasury. A maximum of 2 protocols may be used per DeFi category to minimize liquidity fragmentation. Applicants should make a strong case for the use of their protocol, including a a description of historical success, security, dedicated support for handling issues, a plan for attracting new liquidity, and features of the protocol that will maximize the value to the Cardano treasury if liquidity is deployed to the protocol. New protocols will not be excluded for having limited history, but must make a strong case in other areas of the application.  \n* **Audits and Transparency**  The committee is responsible for creating a monthly report on the funds deployed to protocols and all fees and other costs associated with managing the treasury. All liquidity tokens must be held in the governing smart contract to permit public auditing of funds.  \n* **Costs**  Each member of the committee will be compensated $1,000/month in ADA or the fiat backed stablecoin of their choice ($9,000/month total for all committee members). Compensation for committee members is for their time monitoring funds and the need to be available at any time to take action. The stablecoin reserve fund will cover the costs of minting fiat backed stables, deployment of liquidity to protocols, and rebalancing as needed. Intermittent costs of managing the fund including legal fees after initial legal setup (legal disputes, regulatory issues, etc), audits, KYB/KYC due diligence and other costs may be paid for by the fund. The committee will broadcast any unexpected costs to the community and detail it in the monthly report, and the tDAO may vote to shut down the fund if they deem costs to be excessive.  \n* **Lifetime & Revisions**  The funds from this proposal are intended to remain in ownership of the Cardano community and managed by the committee. It is designed to live in perpetuity, but can be shut down at any time by the tDAO. The committee will follow the directive for the fund described in the Governance Protocol (see supplemental links), which focuses on stablecoins and growing liquidity.\n\n### Why Does Cardano Need Stablecoin Liquidity?\n\nThere is a strong need for better liquidity, especially stablecoin liquidity, in the Cardano ecosystem. Deep stablecoin liquidity helps to serve as an on/off board mechanism for new users as well as a safe haven from market volatility. The Cardano community as a whole benefits from deep stablecoin liquidity, and thus it makes sense to bootstrap this liquidity with funds from the Cardano treasury. In addition to providing mechanisms to onboard new users, deeper liquidity in decentralized exchanges will help stablecoins keep their peg since the stablecoin peg is a function of exchange fees and slippage, where slippage is inversely proportional to liquidity. Put another way, the more liquidity a stablecoin has, the tighter it can maintain its peg.\n\nAs liquidity is bootstrapped, a positive feedback loop will be created, bringing more professional market makers on chain. We see this consistently in traditional finance and in other blockchain ecosystems. Market Makers are more willing to quote tighter spreads and provide more liquidity into an asset once there is sufficient liquidity in that asset. Liquidity begets liquidity. This will also spur more DeFi innovation, bring more developers and retail participation into the Cardano ecosystem, and benefit everyone involved in Cardano.\n\n### Why Fiat Backed Stablecoins?\n\nStablecoins suffer from the 'stablecoin trilemma':\n\n* **Stability** \u2013 maintaining a reliable and resilient peg.  \n* **Decentralization** \u2013 avoiding reliance on centralized entities.  \n* **Capital Efficiency** \u2013 minimizing overcollateralization or complex mechanisms to back the stablecoin\u2019s value. \n\nFiat backed stablecoins tend to be capital efficient (1 USD invested in Treasury Bills, money market funds, banks backs 1 stablecoin) and stable. However, these tend to be more centralized than collateralized debt positions (CDP) backed stablecoins and algorithmic stablecoins. Given the desire to deepen on chain liquidity and create a thriving ecosystem, fiat backed stablecoins make the most sense from a capital efficiency standpoint (especially given their dominance in other thriving blockchain ecosystems).\n\n### Consideration of ADA Price Impact\n\nTreasury funds are in ADA, and must be liquidated to USD in order to mint fiat backed stablecoins. A valid concern with this proposal is the conversion of ADA to USD having a major price impact. It is important to remember that the full 50 million ADA will not be liquidated for stablecoins, since a portion (up to 35%) will need to remain as ADA to pair with stablecoins on DEXs. However, that still leaves a significant sum of ADA that needs to be liquidated for conversion to fiat backed stablecoins.\n\nThere are many mechanisms by which ADA can be liquidated, including direct sales to TradFi funds and OTC deals where ADA will never directly hit the open market to even have a price impact. Other methods include dollar cost averaging and other strategies to gently liquidate ADA so as not to induce a price shock. Even though the ADA liquidation will not be directly sold on an exchange, we want to include an analysis to show what the impact might look like if it were. Looking at only Coinbase ADA volume (the 4th largest ADA exchange by volume), for the last 3 months Coinbase has had an average daily volume of 30 million ADA. This means we could sell 500,000 ADA per day for 65 days to have all the liquidity needed for minting stablecoins, and this volume would represent 1.6% of the daily volume on the 4th largest ADA exchange. Spreading out sales of ADA combined with use of other CEXs (such as Binance, which has even higher daily volumes) would further reduce price impact. Thus, even not accounting for OTC deals and other mechanisms, the amounts of ADA being converted to USD make up a small fraction of daily CEX volume and thus should not have a major impact on ADA price.\n\n### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)\n\n#### 50% Reduction in Stablecoin Slippage\n\nThe primary goal of this proposal is to increase the depth of stablecoin liquidity, and one measure of deeper liquidity on Cardano is reduced slippage. Since slippage is also tied to the size of the order, we use a $100,000 purchase as the benchmark (at $0.9 ADA price, enough to purchase ADA for an info action deposit). For USDM, the current slippage is 4% of USDM and 6% for USDA.\n\n#### 4% Annual Returns to the Treasury\n\nThe primary motive of this project is to increase the depth of liquidity to the Cardano ecosystem, but revenue will naturally be generated from liquidity provision. We expect 4% returns back to the treasury based on the current market conditions for lending yields and DEX liquidity provision assuming a small increase in transaction volume. We believe based on analysis that an increase in volume will follow an increase in TVL since volume and TVL tend to be correlated, so 4% annual returns are a reasonable target.\n\n### Public Goods\n\nThis proposal not only seeks to deploy treasury funds for the good of the Cardano blockchain and create a sustainable source of revenue, but will also create additional benefits for the ecosystem. In particular, the legal structure developed here will help to establish a framework for future proposals that seek similar structure that include executive actions from a committee or board with community oversight. Further, the development of the smart contract to functionally implement such a structure will be open sourced and openly available to the entire community to make use of.",

          "abstract": "This proposal seeks a 5,000,000 ada budget loan from the Cardano Treasury to fund the Cardano Global Listing Expansion, a strategic initiative led by the Snek Foundation to list [SNEK](https://www.snek.com/) on top-tier centralized exchanges, retail brokers, and trading platforms. This proposal is the **first-ever loan-based treasury withdrawal** in Cardano governance, introducing a new model of accountability where funds are not given as grants but repaid with interest.\n\nAs part of the governance process, a Board of Advisors will be appointed to ensure transparent execution and maximize ecosystem alignment. This board will include high-profile industry veterans like Tal Cohen (former CEO of Kraken), Phillip Pon (CEO of Emurgo), Fahmi Syed (President of Midnight Foundation), and Frederik Gregaard (CEO of Cardano Foundation), with additional top-tier names to be announced.\n\n*SNEK is the largest community token on Cardano, holding the highest market capitalization, over 42,000 wallets, and more than 2 billion ADA in all-time trading volume.*\n\nOver the past two years, the Snek Foundation has already invested over $4.5 million, entirely self-funded, to secure major exchange listings. Snek delivered the first, second, and third-ever Tier 1 listings for any Cardano native token, with Kraken, Crypto.com, and Kucoin, setting historic precedents for the ecosystem. With this proposal and with the support of our partners, we aim to unlock greater visibility, liquidity, and accessibility for the broader Cardano ecosystem by leveraging SNEK's proven momentum and market position.\n\nThis loan will be repaid from Snek product revenues and business ventures with the final balance plus interest settled in three to five years, following a closing audit to confirm the loan has been repaid in full. Interest is set at 2.44% annualized (2.37% staking rate + 0.07%), compounded yearly.\n\nBy structuring this as a repayable loan, the Snek Foundation is once again trailblazing for the ecosystem; demonstrating how treasury capital can be deployed responsibly while setting a precedent for future projects. The administrator of the budget funds will be Intersect.",
          "rationale": "## Executive summary\n\nThe [SNEK](https://www.snek.com/) Global Exchange Expansion initiative will execute a targeted listing strategy, using the requested 5M ADA to:\n\n- Finalize negotiations and secure multiple top-tier listings on centralized exchanges, retail brokers, and innovative DeFi platforms\n\n- Provision liquidity and market making for ADA/SNEK pairs\n\n- Cover legal and compliance costs to meet exchange requirements\n\n- Fund mandatory coordination and announcement campaigns\n\n- Report expenditures and impact transparently to the community\n\n### Ecosystem Benefits:\n\n- **Increase ADA liquidity across global trading platforms:** Listings will establish deep liquidity for ADA/SNEK pairs and reinforce ADA's role as a quote asset in broader markets.\n\n- **Expand Cardano visibility among mainstream users:** Presence on Tier 1 CEXs and retail platforms will increase Cardano's exposure where most crypto adoption begins.\n\n- **Establish reusable exchange infrastructure for CNTs:** This initiative creates the legal, technical, and operational framework that future Cardano tokens can leverage.\n\n- **Lay the technical and legal groundwork for future Cardano token listings:** This initiative solves the hardest and most expensive part of Tier 1 onboarding the integrations, KYC, and compliance infrastructure that every CNT would otherwise need to build from scratch. Once completed, this framework can be reused by future projects, massively reducing the technical lift required for Cardano wide exchange access.\n\n- **Drive user acquisition through proven community traction:** Snek's viral momentum helps Cardano tap into the same memecoin fueled onboarding funnels that propelled DOGE and SHIB.\n\n- **Create liquidity bridges for DeFi, NFTs, L2s, and dApps:** Expanded listings make it easier to onboard capital and users into Cardano-native protocols:\n\n- **Document and share listing playbooks with the ecosystem:** All compliance, negotiation, and integration learnings will be captured and shared with the Cardano Foundation and other token teams to accelerate future listings.\n\n### Cardano Treasury and Governance:\n\n- High ROI use of funds by leveraging SNEK as a magnet for adoption\n\n- Support of a community-run initiative with a proven track record\n\n- Back a team that has already invested more than $4.5 million of its own capital into this initiative, and remains committed to continued investment alongside community support.\n\nThe loan will only be used to cover necessary expenses to achieve key listings.\n\nThese costs can vary from one listing to another, but generally include:\n\n- Listing Fees\n\n- Liquidity Provisioning\n\n- Legal & Compliance\n\n- Marketing & Campaign budgets (led by the exchanges)\n\n- Advisory & Transparency Ops\n\nThis loan will be repaid continuously to the treasury from Snek network activities and settled in full after no longer than 5 years from the reception of the funds.\n\n## Loan terms\n\n**Principal:** 5 million ADA\n\n**Interest Rate:** 2.44% APR The loan will accrue interest at the current average Cardano staking rewards rate of 2.37% per year, plus an additional 0.07% as a gesture of good faith\n\n**Repayment Timeline:** Repayments will be made continuously to the Cardano Treasury through multiple ways, including but not limited to: Snek product revenues and business ventures, with direct payments coming from the Snek Foundation treasury. Early payments may begin at any time and loan repayment must commence no later than the last day of year 3.\n\n**Audit & Review:** At the end of year 3, an independent audit will be conducted to review the repayments already made. The audit will verify the amounts reimbursed to date, calculate any outstanding principal and interest, and establish a repayment schedule to ensure the full balance is repaid over the remaining years.\n\n**Default & Enforcement:** In the unlikely event of non-repayment, the obligation will remain enforceable under the binding loan agreement administered by Intersect on behalf of the Treasury. Remedies and next steps would follow the terms of that contract.\n\n**Loan Maturity:** The full loan (principal + interest) must be repaid in full within 5 years from the date of disbursement.\n\n## Administration of the loan\n\nThe administrator of the budget funds will be Intersect, offering continuous oversight. Expenditures will be tracked against the stated use of funds, with reporting, receipts, and independent audits ensuring that spending remains aligned with the proposal's objectives. This approach provides the flexibility required to execute global listings while still offering the Treasury transparent, phased accountability.\n\nAdditionally, a Board of Advisors will be appointed to provide guidance, feedback, and external validation.\n\n**The board will include:**\n\n- Tal Cohen, former CEO of Kraken\n\n- Frederik Gregaard, CEO of Cardano Foundation\n\n- Phillip Pon, CEO of Emurgo\n\n- Fahmi Syed, President of Midnight Foundation\n\n- Rapha C-Roy, CEO of Snek Foundation\n\n**The board's responsibilities:**\n\n- Advise key expenses\n\n- Guide negotiations and legal strategy\n\n- Ensure alignment with Cardano treasury goals\n\n- Ensure outcomes benefit the Cardano ecosystem beyond SNEK\n\n- Support documentation and distribution of listing playbooks to future Cardano-native token teams\n\nThis structure ensures that the project benefits from experienced external input while maintaining decentralized, community-led control over treasury execution.\n\nThe Board will also help facilitate knowledge sharing across the ecosystem by supporting documentation of listing procedures, exchange engagement strategy, and compliance best practices, enabling other Cardano native projects to benefit from this groundwork.\n\nAn allocation of 30-50k ADA per year will be reserved out of the 5M for yearly independent external audit reports, ensuring that the loan is transparently monitored and fully accountable to the Treasury.\n\n## Reporting\n\n#### Bi-Yearly Reports\n\nSnek Foundation will publish bi-yearly updates including:\n\n- Progress on exchange listings\n\n- Funds spent with receipts when allowed\n\n- All legal/compliance materials will be open-sourced when possible\n\n- Learnings from legal, compliance, and integration processes\n\n- Results of independent external audits\n\n#### Knowledge Sharing\n\nAll listing playbooks, integration frameworks, and documentation will be made available to the Cardano Foundation, Emurgo, IOG, and future token teams. Progress will be shared during regular Cardano town halls and across governance channels to maintain transparency and feedback loops to the best of our ability and within contractual regulations.\n\n#  \n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe Snek Foundation has already proven its commitment to Cardano, investing over $4.5M of its own funds into the exact initiative now being proposed for co-funding. This request is not about raising capital for a single token; it is about funding infrastructure, visibility, and adoption for the entire Cardano ecosystem.\n\nThis is not a grant; it is a loan, to be repaid in full with interest, demonstrating our commitment to accountability and sustainability. With dedicated budget allocations for independent audits and transparent reporting, the Treasury will be able to monitor progress, repayments, and compliance throughout the loan term, ensuring this initiative delivers both measurable impact and accountability.\n\n[SNEK](https://www.snek.com/) is currently the only Cardano-native asset that meets Tier 1 exchange requirements.\n\nSupporting this proposal unlocks:\n\n- Immediate listings with global reach\n\n- Deep ADA pair liquidity\n\n- Repeatable frameworks for future CNTs\n\nThe time to act is now.\n\nThe market is receptive, Snek has momentum, and the Cardano ecosystem is ready to scale its visibility. This proposal is how we turn years of effort into lasting, reusable infrastructure.\n\n## Constitutionality checklist\n\n#### Purpose\n\n- This proposal is for work intended to enhance the security, decentralization and long-term sustainability of Cardano.\n\n#### Article III.5: the process of on-chain governance\n\n- Proposal is submitted in a legible, standardized format and includes rationale, budget, administration plan, and reporting framework.\n\n#### Article IV.1: proposing budgets\n\n- This proposal supports Cardano blockchain adoption, liquidity, and token infrastructure.\n\n#### Article IV.2: funds administration\n\n- This proposal specifies an administrator in accordance with this provision. The budget is administered and documented by a named party (Intersect), with oversight of an off-chain committee (board of trusted advisors).\n\n#### Article IV.3: Net-Change Limit\n\n- Being of \u20b35M and covering the second half of 2025, this proposal and the treasury withdrawals it would enable do not violate the currently agreed upon Net-Change Limit.\n\n#### Article IV.4: Auditor\n\n- This proposal makes provisions for an auditor: An allocation of 30-50k ADA per year will be reserved for yearly independent external audit reports, ensuring that the loan is transparently monitored and fully accountable to the Treasury.\n\n#### Guardrails\n\n- This proposal is subject to TREASURY-04a in that it defines a Cardano blockchain ecosystem budget. It requires a threshold greater than 50% of the DReps' active voting stake to be considered approved and enable subsequent withdrawals pertaining to this budget.",
          "motivation": "## Who we are\n\nSnek Foundation is a grassroots organization responsible for launching and maintaining the SNEK ecosystem. Snek has never raised external funds for exchange listings and has operated for the past 29 months, entirely self-funded through its revenue and treasury.\n\nSo far, more than $ 4.5 million has been invested by the Snek Foundation towards listing activities.\n\n**Since May 2023, Snek has:**\n\n- 42,000+ wallets holding SNEK --- the most actively held token on Cardano\n\n- 2,000,000,000 ADA in all-time trading volume --- the most traded token on Cardano\n\n- SNEK is the most well-known token in and out of the Cardano ecosystem, with 30 markets\n\n- Self-funded $4.5M for exchange listing activities\n\n- Delivered the three first-ever Tier 1 exchange listings for Cardano via Kraken, Crypto.com, and Kucoin.\n\n- Developed the first-ever CEX-DEX market-making service with Flowdesk\n\n- Launched Snek.fun, Cardano's leading launchpad, driving over 30% of all chain trades since inception\n\n- Trademarked brand with ongoing IP licensing deals (Snek Figures, Snek Energy)\n\nThe team has a successful track record negotiating listings, building tools, and driving global meme adoption aligned with Cardano's values.\n\n## Why this proposal matters\n\nSNEK is Cardano's most adopted token, yet it remains underrepresented on major centralized exchanges, reflecting a broader lack of visibility for Cardano on mainstream platforms and among broader audiences.\n\nThis underrepresentation doesn't just affect SNEK. It weakens Cardano's position in competitive markets and slows ecosystem-wide growth in four key areas:\n\n1.  ADA's visibility and liquidity on global platforms\n\n2.  Cardano's competitiveness in retail-driven market cycles\n\n3.  The discoverability of Cardano's ecosystem by mainstream users\n\n4.  CNT adoption and the path for other tokens to reach similar success\n\nCardano currently lacks a flagship token that drives liquidity, virality, and culture across exchange listings, just like DOGE, SHIBA, and PEPE do for Ethereum and Solana.\n\nSNEK has already shown it can fill this role; now it needs support to break through at scale.\n\n**This proposal aims to address the following challenges:**\n\n- **Lack of exchange presence for Cardano native tokens:** Most major centralized exchanges and retail brokers still do not support Cardano Native Tokens (CNTs). This severely limits Cardano's accessibility and competitiveness on a global scale. While Ethereum and Solana ecosystems enjoy deep integrations with top exchanges, Cardano-native projects are left with fewer liquidity pathways and less discoverability. Until CNTs are more visible on mainstream platforms, Cardano's on-chain economy cannot reach its full potential.\n\n- **Low visibility for ADA pairings:** Centralized exchanges are the primary entry point for millions of users, yet ADA trading pairs are underrepresented relative to Cardano's market cap. Without community-driven assets like SNEK creating demand for ADA pairings, liquidity remains shallow and volume muted. This proposal helps bootstrap those pairings, supporting deeper ADA liquidity and reinforcing Cardano's relevance at the trading layer.\n\n- **Missed user acquisition:** In other ecosystems, memecoins like SHIB, DOGE, and PEPE have served as cultural gateways for millions of new retail users. These tokens create stories, engagement, and participation, driving demand for the base layer tokens and ecosystem tools. SNEK has proven it can play that role for Cardano. Without support to elevate its accessibility, Cardano risks missing this powerful user acquisition funnel.\n\n- **Liquidity fragmentation:** Cardano's DeFi protocols face high barriers to liquidity aggregation due to the lack of bridgeable, on-ramp-compatible assets. Without listings on major exchanges, Cardano native assets remain siloed and isolated from the broader crypto capital flows, limiting scalability and adoption.\n\nBy funding this initiative, Cardano positions itself to solve these bottlenecks through a trusted, culturally strong and community-proven asset that can serve as a gateway for users and liquidity.\n\nToday, Snek is the only Cardano-native token capable of meeting Tier 1 exchange requirements. This makes it the best and currently only viable gateway to unlock the access, liquidity, and visibility Cardano needs at the global level.\n\nThe goal is not exclusivity --- it's scalability. By leading the way through Snek, we create a repeatable path for other CNTs to follow. The foundation has already begun sharing its knowledge with other projects post-Kraken, and through this proposal, will continue building and systematizing resources that can be shared with Cardano Foundation, Emurgo, and IOG.",

          "abstract": "The Cardano in Oceania 2025\u20132026 strategy and budget is a comprehensive plan designed to ignite Cardano\u2019s growth in a strategically important region. By investing in people (capacity building and community), projects (hackathons and pilots), and promotion (marketing and storytelling), we create a virtuous cycle: more talent and awareness leads to more projects, which lead to real adoption and success stories, which in turn attract even more talent and partnerships. This aligns closely with Cardano\u2019s mission of building a world-changing ecosystem \u2013 starting locally in Oceania, with ripples globally.",
          "rationale": "\n## Executive summary\n\nCardano in Oceania will deliver a practical engine for adoption by building a regional business-development track \u2014 training and mentoring local advocates, aligning efforts with global ecosystem teams, and pursuing real pilots with enterprises, startups, academia, and public agencies. In parallel, it will map the people, projects, and capabilities across the region into an interactive network, then use that map to convene roundtables, spot gaps, and actively match talent to opportunities so Cardano projects ship faster.\n\nMomentum comes from hands-on community activation and clear storytelling: a stronger presence at major tech events, a flagship hackathon, a cadence of local meetups and governance workshops, and an integrated marketing push that empowers community content creators, surfaces regional case studies, and localises outreach for Oceania audiences. Together, these streams turn strategy into visible outcomes and a repeatable model other regions can adopt.\n\nWe request that DReps and other assessors review the full details of our strategic plan, which includes the program of work, budget breakdown, milestones and KPIs, available at https://cardano-in-oceania.github.io. To ensure the immutability of the content on this website, the hash of the Git commit for the markdown and other files used to build the website (using the GitHub Pages feature) is available in the \u201cReferences\u201d section of this metadata and in the footer of the website. By including the website hash in this metadata, it is included as part of generating the metadata hash submitted with this governance action on-chain.\n\n## Amount\n\nThe total amount requested through this budget is 778,000 ada.\n\n## Administration of the Cardano Funds\n\nThe administration of funds for this proposal will be conducted in a transparent, accountable, and constitutionally aligned manner. To ensure proper oversight, the following processes and roles are defined:\n\n\n### Administrator\n\nThe budget will be administered by **selfdriven Services**, acting in good faith on behalf of the Cardano community. The administrator will manage disbursements, verify milestone evidence, and uphold the principles of fairness and transparency. All administration activities will be traceable, with references to GitHub commits and IPFS hashes to guarantee immutability.\n\n### Milestone Processing\n\nFunds will be released on a milestone-by-milestone basis. For each milestone, the proposer must submit clear evidence of completion to the GitHub repository maintained by selfdriven Services. Evidence may include documentation, educational resources, participation data, or other relevant deliverables. Milestones will be processed efficiently, and funds will not be unduly withheld once requirements have been met.\n\n### Dispute Resolution\n\nIn the event of disagreement regarding milestone delivery, determinations made by the selfdriven Services Financial Administrator will be considered final and binding in the first instance. However, proposers retain the right to escalate disputes to the Cardano community by submitting an Info-Action to the DReps, including all relevant evidence. If more than 50% of DReps vote in favour of the appeal, the administrator will recognise this decision and co-sign the transaction accordingly. This ensures that ultimate oversight remains with the decentralised governance process, in line with the Constitution.\n\n### Cardano Addresses\n\n* Treasury funds will be received into addresses specifically designated for this proposal. To safeguard neutrality and accountability:\n* The addresses will be delegated to the **Auto-Abstain DRep**, ensuring they are not used to influence governance decisions.\nThey will also remain **unstaked to any Stake Pool Operator (SPO)**, ensuring that funds cannot generate staking rewards or confer advantage to specific pools.\n\nThrough these measures, administration of the budget ensures that funds are responsibly managed, that milestones are verifiable and tied to real outcomes, and that disputes can be resolved transparently within Cardano\u2019s governance framework.\nMore information about selfdriven Services is available at https://selfdriven.services.  A link to the document and hash available in the Reference.\n\n## Reporting\n\nAll reporting for this initiative will be conducted in a transparent, open, and verifiable manner, directly tied to the obligations and milestone processes outlined above.\n\n### Milestone Evidence\n\nIn accordance with the Processing of Milestones obligation, evidence for each milestone will be submitted to the GitHub repository maintained by selfdriven Services. This evidence will include reports, educational materials, event records, governance engagement summaries, and other outputs relevant to the stated objectives.\n\n### Frequency of Reports\n\nReports will be provided at the completion of each milestone. Each report will contain:\n* A description of activities undertaken and alignment with the proposal\u2019s objectives.\n* A summary of outcomes, including metrics such as participation numbers, partnerships formed, or educational content delivered.\n* Links and hashes to all supporting evidence, stored in GitHub and/or IPFS.\n* A financial statement showing allocation and expenditure for the reporting period.\n* Community Oversight.\n\nReports will be made publicly available, enabling the Cardano community to review and provide feedback. Any disputes regarding reported outcomes will follow the Dispute Resolution process described earlier, whereby appeals may be made through the DReps Info-Action mechanism.\n\n### Auditing\n\nIn alignment with Article IV.4 of the Constitution, provision is made for an independent auditor to verify reporting accuracy, compliance with milestones, and adherence to governance principles.\n\n## Constitutionality checklist\n\n### Purpose\n\nThis proposal establishes a **community-led** regional budget that catalyses real-world Cardano adoption throughout Oceania \u2014 standing up a business-development track, mapping and convening the ecosystem, and scaling hands-on community engagement, governance, and education. The goal is to deepen decentralisation and inclusion while turning strategy into visible, real-world pilots and a **repeatable model** other regions can adapt for sustainable, long-term growth.\n\n### Article III.5: The process of on-chain governance\n\n* The proposal has been submitted in a standardised, legible format.\n* All supporting documentation is published with URLs and hashes (GitHub commits and IPFS references) to ensure immutability and verifiability.\n* The proposal includes a clear title, abstract, rationale, and supporting materials sufficient for governance decision-making.\n\n### Article IV.2: Funds administration\n\n* An administrator (selfdriven Services) is specified, fulfilling the requirements of this provision.\n* The proposal defines an internal process for fund administration using milestone submissions, dispute resolution mechanisms, and transparent reporting, all consistent with decentralised governance principles.\n\n### Article IV.3: Net-Change Limit\n\n* The requested amount does not exceed the current Net-Change Limit.\n* Treasury withdrawals under this budget are therefore constitutional and compliant with the safeguard against excessive expenditure.\n\n### Article IV.4: Auditor\n\n* The proposal makes provision for an independent auditor to verify milestone evidence and financial accountability.\n* This ensures compliance with constitutional audit requirements.\n\n### Guardrails\n\n* This proposal is subject to TREASURY-04a, as it defines a Cardano blockchain ecosystem budget.\n* Approval requires a threshold of >50% of the DReps\u2019 active voting stake.\n* Once approved, subsequent withdrawals pertaining to this budget will proceed only in accordance with the reporting, obligation, and dispute resolution processes set out in this proposal.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCardano in Oceania represents a forward-looking investment in decentralisation, inclusion, and sustainability. By extending Cardano\u2019s reach into Oceania, this initiative strengthens the network\u2019s global resilience, broadens representation in governance, and builds durable structures for education and collaboration.\n\n### This proposal embeds accountability and constitutional alignment through:\n\n* Obligations that define responsibilities for milestone delivery.\n* Milestone Processing that ensures evidence is submitted, reviewed, and publicly verifiable.\n* Dispute Resolution that offers community-based appeals via DReps.\n* Reporting that ensures transparency and financial accountability.\n* Auditing that provides an independent safeguard.\n\nTogether, these mechanisms provide a strong framework of checks and balances. By approving this budget, the Cardano community affirms its commitment to an inclusive and globally distributed ecosystem, ensuring Oceania\u2019s voices, talents, and ideas contribute to Cardano\u2019s long-term growth and success.",
          "motivation": "This initiative is aligned with the principles of the Cardano Constitution and directly contributes to the network\u2019s growth and adoption. By expanding Cardano\u2019s presence in Oceania, the project strengthens decentralisation, reduces reliance on specific geographic regions, and enhances the network\u2019s global resilience.\n\nOceania provides a unique and valuable testbed for piloting community-driven growth and adoption strategies. Its diversity of cultures, economies, and geographies allows for experimentation with scalable models of grassroots activation that can later be replicated in other regions worldwide. By engaging local communities, universities, businesses, and civic organisations, Cardano in Oceania demonstrates how decentralised technologies can deliver tangible impact at the community level.\n\nThis initiative promotes inclusion by welcoming underrepresented voices into Cardano\u2019s governance and innovation processes, making the ecosystem more diverse and representative. It ensures transparency by openly publishing plans, progress, and evidence, reinforcing accountability and trust. It fosters collaboration by linking developers, educators, and enthusiasts locally with the broader global Cardano community, in line with the Constitution\u2019s call for cooperative, community-driven development.\n\nFinally, it prioritises sustainability by investing in durable community structures, education programs, and partnerships that will support Cardano\u2019s growth and adoption for generations to come.\n\n**In short, Oceania is where Cardano can prove that decentralised, community-driven growth and adoption works.**",

          "title": "Withdraw \u20b35M for Cardano's Global Listing Expansion - Powered by Snek",
          "abstract": "This treasury withdrawal funds the Cardano Global Listing Expansion initiative, a strategic proposal by the Snek Foundation to list SNEK on major centralized exchanges (CEXs), retail brokers, and other widely adopted platforms. SNEK is the largest community token on Cardano, holding the highest market capitalization, over 42,000 wallets, and more than 2 billion ADA in all-time trading volume. \n\nOver the past two years, the Snek Foundation has already invested over $4 million, entirely self funded, to secure major exchange listings. We\u2019ve delivered the first and second ever Tier 1 listings for any Cardano native token, with Kraken and Crypto.com setting historic precedents for the ecosystem. These were not isolated wins, but the first step in a broader strategy to unlock global market access for Cardano.\n\nThis proposal seeks 5,000,000 ADA to support top-tier exchange listings, liquidity provisioning, legal and compliance services, and strategic advisory oversight. These listings will not only increase SNEK adoption but also bring unprecedented visibility, liquidity, and user acquisition opportunities to the entire Cardano ecosystem. As part of the governance process, a Board of Advisors will be appointed to ensure transparent execution and maximize ecosystem alignment. This board will include high-profile industry veterans like Tal Cohen (former CEO of Kraken) and Phillip Pon (CEO of Emurgo), with additional top-tier names to be announced.\n\nSNEK is Cardano\u2019s most adopted token, yet it remains underrepresented on major centralized exchanges, reflecting a broader lack of visibility for Cardano on mainstream platforms and among broader audiences.\n\nThis underrepresentation doesn\u2019t just affect SNEK. It weakens Cardano\u2019s position in competitive markets and slows ecosystem-wide growth in four key areas:\n- ADA\u2019s visibility and liquidity on global platforms\n- Cardano\u2019s competitiveness in retail-driven market cycles\n- The discoverability of Cardano\u2019s ecosystem by mainstream users\n- CNT adoption and the path for other tokens to reach similar success\n\nCardano currently lacks a flagship token that drives liquidity, virality, and culture across exchange listings, just like DOGE, SHIBA, and PEPE do for Ethereum and Solana.\nSNEK has already shown it can fill this role; now it needs support to break through at scale.",
          "rationale": "## Project Solution\n\nThe SNEK Global Exchange Expansion initiative will execute a targeted listing strategy, using the requested 5M ADA to:\n- Finalize negotiations and secure multiple top-tier listings on centralized exchanges, retail brokers, and innovative DeFi platforms\n- Provision liquidity and market making for ADA/SNEK pairs\n- Cover legal and compliance costs to meet exchange requirements\n- Fund mandatory coordination and announcement campaigns\n- Report expenditures and impact transparently to the community\n\nEcosystem Benefits:\n\n- **Increase ADA liquidity across global trading platforms:** Listings will establish deep liquidity for ADA/SNEK pairs and reinforce ADA\u2019s role as a quote asset in broader markets.\n\n- **Expand Cardano visibility among mainstream users:** Presence on Tier 1 CEXs and retail platforms will increase Cardano\u2019s exposure where most crypto adoption begins.\n\n- **Establish reusable exchange infrastructure for CNTs:** This initiative creates the legal, technical, and operational framework that future Cardano tokens can leverage.\n\n- **Lay the technical and legal groundwork for future Cardano token listings:** This initiative solves the hardest and most expensive part of Tier 1 onboarding the integrations, KYC, and compliance infrastructure that every CNT would otherwise need to build from scratch. Once completed, this framework can be reused by future projects, massively reducing the technical lift required for Cardano wide exchange access.\n\n- **Drive user acquisition through proven community traction:** Snek\u2019s viral momentum helps Cardano tap into the same memecoin fueled onboarding funnels that propelled DOGE and SHIB.\n\n- **Create liquidity bridges for DeFi, NFTs, L2s, and dApps:** Expanded listings make it easier to onboard capital and users into Cardano-native protocols:\n\n- **Document and share listing playbooks with the ecosystem:** All compliance, negotiation, and integration learnings will be captured and shared with the Cardano Foundation and other token teams to accelerate future listings.\n\nCardano Treasury and Governance:\n- High ROI use of funds by leveraging SNEK as a magnet for adoption\n- Support of a community-run initiative with a proven track record\n- Back a team that has already invested more than $4 million of its own capital into this initiative, and remains committed to continued investment alongside community support.\n\n## Listing Strategy\n\nThis proposal prioritizes high-impact, global-facing exchanges and service providers, with some already at the later stages for listing. Including but not limited to:\n\n- **Tier 1 & 2 CEXs:** Coinbase, Binance, Crypto.com, KuCoin, OKX, Upbit, HTX, Bybit\n\n- **Retail Brokers:** Robinhood, Revolut, MoonPay, eToro, Uphold\n\n- **Innovative DeFi:** Hyperliquid (for perpetuals and trading)\n\nThese platforms represent critical access points for onboarding new users, increasing ADA liquidity, and bringing Cardano native tokens into mainstream crypto finance.\n\nThis strategy marks the next step toward large-scale adoption of Cardano native assets (CNTs). We already have multiple offers under consideration, and access to a larger budget through this treasury proposal will allow us to negotiate more effectively, secure better placement, and maximize impact for the broader Cardano ecosystem.\n\n## Vendor Profile\n\nSnek Foundation is a grassroots organization responsible for launching and maintaining the SNEK ecosystem. Snek has never raised external funds for exchange listings and has operated for the past 29 months, entirely self-funded through its revenue and treasury.\n\nSince May 2023, Snek has:\n- 42,000+ wallets holding SNEK \u2014 the most actively held token on Cardano\n- 2,000,000,000 ADA in all-time trading volume \u2014 the most traded token on Cardano\n- SNEK is the most well-known token in and out of the Cardano ecosystem, with 30 markets\n- Self-funded $4M for exchange listings\n- Delivered the first and second-ever Tier 1 exchange listings for Cardano via Kraken and Crypto.com\n- Developed the first ever CEX-DEX market-making service with Flowdesk\n- Launched Snek.fun, Cardano\u2019s leading launchpad, driving over 30% of all chain trades since inception\n- Trademarked brand with ongoing IP licensing deals (Snek Figures, Snek Energy)\n\nThe team has a successful track record negotiating listings, building tools, and driving global meme adoption aligned with Cardano\u2019s values.\n\nThe goal is not exclusivity \u2014 it\u2019s scalability. By leading the way through Snek, we create a repeatable path for other CNTs to follow. The foundation has already begun sharing its knowledge with other projects post-Kraken, and through this proposal, will continue building and systematizing resources that can be shared with Cardano Foundation, Emurgo, and IOG.\n\n## Governance and Oversight\n\nA Board of Advisors will be appointed to provide guidance, feedback, and external validation. The board will include:\n- Tal Cohen, former CEO of Kraken\n- Phillip Pon, CEO of Emurgo\n- Rapha C-Roy, CEO of Snek Foundation\n- Prominent leaders from the Cardano ecosystem and the compliance sector - more to come on this. \n\nThe board\u2019s responsibilities:\n- Advise key expenses\n- Guide negotiations and legal strategy\n- Ensure alignment with Cardano treasury goals\n- Ensure outcomes benefit the Cardano ecosystem beyond SNEK\n- Support documentation and distribution of listing playbooks to future Cardano-native token teams\n\nThis structure ensures that the project benefits from experienced external input while maintaining decentralized, community-led control over treasury execution.\n\nThe Board will also help facilitate knowledge sharing across the ecosystem by supporting documentation of listing procedures, exchange engagement strategy, and compliance best practices, enabling other Cardano native projects to benefit from this groundwork.\n\n## Budget\n\nThe funds will only be used to cover necessary expenses to achieve key listings. These costs can vary from one listing to another, but generally include:\n- Listing Fees\n- Liquidity Provisioning\n- Legal & Compliance\n- Marketing & Campaign budgets (led by the exchanges)\n- Advisory & Transparency Ops\n\nAny unused funds will be returned to the treasury.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Snek Foundation has self funded the growth of SNEK to date, all prior centralized exchange listings, marketing, and infrastructure without relying on any community raise or token sale. Over the past two years, the Snek Foundation has invested more than $4 million USD into listings alone, funded entirely through project revenue and the Snek treasury.\n\nThis proposal marks the first time the Foundation is requesting support from the Cardano community to unlock broader exchange access, liquidity, and visibility for the entire Cardano ecosystem.\n\nBacking this initiative isn\u2019t simply an investment in a single token. It\u2019s a strategic investment in Cardano\u2019s reach, relevance, and competitiveness in the global crypto landscape. SNEK has already proven itself as both a cultural and technical leader on Cardano and, more importantly, as a project that\u2019s trusted to consistently deliver. With community support, we can continue to open doors that benefit every user, builder, and token in the ecosystem.\n\nThis proposal isn\u2019t just about Snek \u2014 it\u2019s about what Snek enables for Cardano. We\u2019ve already proven that major platforms are willing to list CNTs when the right infrastructure, compliance, and community story are in place. With $4M+ of our own capital invested and Tier 1 listings already live, we\u2019ve eliminated the risk and shown the upside. Now, with treasury support, we can go further \u2014 expanding access, sharing the roadmap, and giving every Cardano project the chance to follow.",
          "motivation": "This proposal aims to address the following challenges:\n\n- **Lack of exchange presence for Cardano native tokens:** Most major centralized exchanges and retail brokers still do not support Cardano Native Tokens (CNTs). This severely limits Cardano\u2019s accessibility and competitiveness on a global scale. While Ethereum and Solana ecosystems enjoy deep integrations with top exchanges, Cardano-native projects are left with fewer liquidity pathways and less discoverability. Until CNTs are more visible on mainstream platforms, Cardano\u2019s on-chain economy cannot reach its full potential.\n\n- **Low visibility for ADA pairings:** Centralized exchanges are the primary entry point for millions of users, yet ADA trading pairs are underrepresented relative to Cardano\u2019s market cap. Without community-driven assets like SNEK creating demand for ADA pairings, liquidity remains shallow and volume muted. This proposal helps bootstrap those pairings, supporting deeper ADA liquidity and reinforcing Cardano\u2019s relevance at the trading layer.\n\n- **Missed user acquisition:** In other ecosystems, memecoins like SHIB, DOGE, and PEPE have served as cultural gateways for millions of new retail users. These tokens create stories, engagement, and participation, driving demand for the base layer tokens and ecosystem tools. SNEK has proven it can play that role for Cardano. Without support to elevate its accessibility, Cardano risks missing this powerful user acquisition funnel.\n\n- **Liquidity fragmentation:** Cardano\u2019s DeFi protocols face high barriers to liquidity aggregation due to the lack of bridgeable, on-ramp-compatible assets. Without listings on major exchanges, Cardano native assets remain siloed and isolated from the broader crypto capital flows, limiting scalability and adoption.\n\nBy funding this initiative, Cardano positions itself to solve these bottlenecks through a trusted, culturally strong and community-proven asset that can serve as a gateway for users and liquidity.\n\nToday, Snek is the only Cardano-native token capable of meeting Tier 1 exchange requirements. This makes it the best and currently only viable gateway to unlock the access, liquidity, and visibility Cardano needs at the global level.",

          "title": "Cardano Global Listing Expansion - Powered by Snek",
          "abstract": "This treasury withdrawal funds the Cardano Global Listing Expansion initiative, a strategic proposal by the Snek Foundation to list SNEK on major centralized exchanges (CEXs), retail brokers, and other widely adopted platforms. SNEK is the largest community token on Cardano, holding the highest market capitalization, over 42,000 wallets, and more than 2 billion ADA in all-time trading volume. \n\nOver the past two years, the Snek Foundation has already invested over $4 million, entirely self funded, to secure major exchange listings. We\u2019ve delivered the first and second ever Tier 1 listings for any Cardano native token, with Kraken and Crypto.com setting historic precedents for the ecosystem. These were not isolated wins, but the first step in a broader strategy to unlock global market access for Cardano.\n\nThis proposal seeks 5,000,000 ADA to support top-tier exchange listings, liquidity provisioning, legal and compliance services, and strategic advisory oversight. These listings will not only increase SNEK adoption but also bring unprecedented visibility, liquidity, and user acquisition opportunities to the entire Cardano ecosystem. As part of the governance process, a Board of Advisors will be appointed to ensure transparent execution and maximize ecosystem alignment. This board will include high-profile industry veterans like Tal Cohen (former CEO of Kraken) and Phillip Pon (CEO of Emurgo), with additional top-tier names to be announced.\n\nSNEK is Cardano\u2019s most adopted token, yet it remains underrepresented on major centralized exchanges, reflecting a broader lack of visibility for Cardano on mainstream platforms and among broader audiences.\n\nThis underrepresentation doesn\u2019t just affect SNEK. It weakens Cardano\u2019s position in competitive markets and slows ecosystem-wide growth in four key areas:\n- ADA\u2019s visibility and liquidity on global platforms\n- Cardano\u2019s competitiveness in retail-driven market cycles\n- The discoverability of Cardano\u2019s ecosystem by mainstream users\n- CNT adoption and the path for other tokens to reach similar success\n\nCardano currently lacks a flagship token that drives liquidity, virality, and culture across exchange listings, just like DOGE, SHIBA, and PEPE do for Ethereum and Solana.\nSNEK has already shown it can fill this role; now it needs support to break through at scale.",
          "rationale": "## Project Solution\n\nThe SNEK Global Exchange Expansion initiative will execute a targeted listing strategy, using the requested 5M ADA to:\n- Finalize negotiations and secure multiple top-tier listings on centralized exchanges, retail brokers, and innovative DeFi platforms\n- Provision liquidity and market making for ADA/SNEK pairs\n- Cover legal and compliance costs to meet exchange requirements\n- Fund mandatory coordination and announcement campaigns\n- Report expenditures and impact transparently to the community\n\nEcosystem Benefits:\n\n- **Increase ADA liquidity across global trading platforms:** Listings will establish deep liquidity for ADA/SNEK pairs and reinforce ADA\u2019s role as a quote asset in broader markets.\n\n- **Expand Cardano visibility among mainstream users:** Presence on Tier 1 CEXs and retail platforms will increase Cardano\u2019s exposure where most crypto adoption begins.\n\n- **Establish reusable exchange infrastructure for CNTs:** This initiative creates the legal, technical, and operational framework that future Cardano tokens can leverage.\n\n- **Lay the technical and legal groundwork for future Cardano token listings:** This initiative solves the hardest and most expensive part of Tier 1 onboarding the integrations, KYC, and compliance infrastructure that every CNT would otherwise need to build from scratch. Once completed, this framework can be reused by future projects, massively reducing the technical lift required for Cardano wide exchange access.\n\n- **Drive user acquisition through proven community traction:** Snek\u2019s viral momentum helps Cardano tap into the same memecoin fueled onboarding funnels that propelled DOGE and SHIB.\n\n- **Create liquidity bridges for DeFi, NFTs, L2s, and dApps:** Expanded listings make it easier to onboard capital and users into Cardano-native protocols:\n\n- **Document and share listing playbooks with the ecosystem:** All compliance, negotiation, and integration learnings will be captured and shared with the Cardano Foundation and other token teams to accelerate future listings.\n\nCardano Treasury and Governance:\n- High ROI use of funds by leveraging SNEK as a magnet for adoption\n- Support of a community-run initiative with a proven track record\n- Back a team that has already invested more than $4 million of its own capital into this initiative, and remains committed to continued investment alongside community support.\n\n## Listing Strategy\n\nThis proposal prioritizes high-impact, global-facing exchanges and service providers, with some already at the later stages for listing. Including but not limited to:\n\n- **Tier 1 & 2 CEXs:** Coinbase, Binance, Crypto.com, KuCoin, OKX, Upbit, HTX, Bybit\n\n- **Retail Brokers:** Robinhood, Revolut, MoonPay, eToro, Uphold\n\n- **Innovative DeFi:** Hyperliquid (for perpetuals and trading)\n\nThese platforms represent critical access points for onboarding new users, increasing ADA liquidity, and bringing Cardano native tokens into mainstream crypto finance.\n\nThis strategy marks the next step toward large-scale adoption of Cardano native assets (CNTs). We already have multiple offers under consideration, and access to a larger budget through this treasury proposal will allow us to negotiate more effectively, secure better placement, and maximize impact for the broader Cardano ecosystem.\n\n## Vendor Profile\n\nSnek Foundation is a grassroots organization responsible for launching and maintaining the SNEK ecosystem. Snek has never raised external funds for exchange listings and has operated for the past 29 months, entirely self-funded through its revenue and treasury.\n\nSince May 2023, Snek has:\n- 42,000+ wallets holding SNEK \u2014 the most actively held token on Cardano\n- 2,000,000,000 ADA in all-time trading volume \u2014 the most traded token on Cardano\n- SNEK is the most well-known token in and out of the Cardano ecosystem, with 30 markets\n- Self-funded $4M for exchange listings\n- Delivered the first and second-ever Tier 1 exchange listings for Cardano via Kraken and Crypto.com\n- Developed the first ever CEX-DEX market-making service with Flowdesk\n- Launched Snek.fun, Cardano\u2019s leading launchpad, driving over 30% of all chain trades since inception\n- Trademarked brand with ongoing IP licensing deals (Snek Figures, Snek Energy)\n\nThe team has a successful track record negotiating listings, building tools, and driving global meme adoption aligned with Cardano\u2019s values.\n\nThe goal is not exclusivity \u2014 it\u2019s scalability. By leading the way through Snek, we create a repeatable path for other CNTs to follow. The foundation has already begun sharing its knowledge with other projects post-Kraken, and through this proposal, will continue building and systematizing resources that can be shared with Cardano Foundation, Emurgo, and IOG.\n\n## Governance and Oversight\n\nA Board of Advisors will be appointed to provide guidance, feedback, and external validation. The board will include:\n- Tal Cohen, former CEO of Kraken\n- Phillip Pon, CEO of Emurgo\n- Rapha C-Roy, CEO of Snek Foundation\n- Prominent leaders from the Cardano ecosystem and the compliance sector - more to come on this. \n\nThe board\u2019s responsibilities:\n- Advise key expenses\n- Guide negotiations and legal strategy\n- Ensure alignment with Cardano treasury goals\n- Ensure outcomes benefit the Cardano ecosystem beyond SNEK\n- Support documentation and distribution of listing playbooks to future Cardano-native token teams\n\nThis structure ensures that the project benefits from experienced external input while maintaining decentralized, community-led control over treasury execution.\n\nThe Board will also help facilitate knowledge sharing across the ecosystem by supporting documentation of listing procedures, exchange engagement strategy, and compliance best practices, enabling other Cardano native projects to benefit from this groundwork.\n\n## Budget\n\nThe funds will only be used to cover necessary expenses to achieve key listings. These costs can vary from one listing to another, but generally include:\n- Listing Fees\n- Liquidity Provisioning\n- Legal & Compliance\n- Marketing & Campaign budgets (led by the exchanges)\n- Advisory & Transparency Ops\n\nAny unused funds will be returned to the treasury.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Snek Foundation has self funded the growth of SNEK to date, all prior centralized exchange listings, marketing, and infrastructure without relying on any community raise or token sale. Over the past two years, the Snek Foundation has invested more than $4 million USD into listings alone, funded entirely through project revenue and the Snek treasury.\n\nThis proposal marks the first time the Foundation is requesting support from the Cardano community to unlock broader exchange access, liquidity, and visibility for the entire Cardano ecosystem.\n\nBacking this initiative isn\u2019t simply an investment in a single token. It\u2019s a strategic investment in Cardano\u2019s reach, relevance, and competitiveness in the global crypto landscape. SNEK has already proven itself as both a cultural and technical leader on Cardano and, more importantly, as a project that\u2019s trusted to consistently deliver. With community support, we can continue to open doors that benefit every user, builder, and token in the ecosystem.\n\nThis proposal isn\u2019t just about Snek \u2014 it\u2019s about what Snek enables for Cardano. We\u2019ve already proven that major platforms are willing to list CNTs when the right infrastructure, compliance, and community story are in place. With $4M+ of our own capital invested and Tier 1 listings already live, we\u2019ve eliminated the risk and shown the upside.

          "rationale": "In accordance with the constitutional mandate for this election, seven committee seats were filled with staggered terms to ensure continuity. The election, which filled three seats for a 146-epoch term (approximately two years) and four seats for a 73-epoch term (approximately one year), incorporated a novel selection method.\n\nFollowing the tallying of votes, the candidate with the highest number of votes was given the first choice of term length, either 146 or 73 epochs. Subsequently, the second-ranked candidate chose from the remaining options, and so on, until all term lengths were selected. This continued until only one option remained for the final candidates.\n\nThis governance action officially endorses the results of that electoral process, cementing the composition of the committee with its staggered terms designed to ensure operational continuity.\n\n**Note on Term Length Estimation:** The expiration epochs are estimates calculated for this governance action. The estimation accounts for the action's maximum 6-epoch lifetime, plus one epoch for enactment, in addition to the 73 or 146-epoch term length chosen by each member. Should this governance action be ratified sooner than its final epoch, the actual term for each member will be correspondingly longer.\n\n**For example:** As this governance action has a 6-epoch lifetime, if it is ratified in epoch 2, the committee members' terms would be 4 epochs longer than the minimum estimate.\n\nThe elected members are:\n\n| **Member** | **Cold Credential** | **Term Length Estimate** | **Expiration Epoch** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Cardano Atlantic Council | script-hash-349e55f83e9af24813e6cb368df6a80d38951b2a334dfcdf26815558 | 73 | 653 |\n| Tingvard | script-hash-1980dbf1ad624b0cb5410359b5ab14d008561994a6c2b6c53fabec00 | 146 | 726 |\n| Eastern Cardano Council | script-hash-84aebcfd3e00d0f87af918fc4b5e00135f407e379893df7e7d392c6a | 146 | 726 |\n| KtorZ | key-hash-dc0d6ef49590eb6880a50a00adde17596e6d76f7159572fa1ff85f2a | 73 | 653 |\n Ace Alliance | script-hash-9752e4306e5ae864441d21064f791174c8b626199b8e7a45f9e03b45 | 146 | 726 |\n| Cardano Japan Council | script-hash-9cc3f387623f45dae6a68b7096b0c2e403d8601a82dc40221ead41e2 | 73 | 653 |\n| Phil_uplc | key-hash-13493790d9b03483a1e1e684ea4faf1ee48a58f402574e7f2246f4d4 | 73 | 653 |\n\n**Note 1:** Term lengths were chosen by members based on their final tally position in the election. Cardano Atlantic Council, Tingvard, and the Eastern Cardano Council had first right of refusal to a two-year (146 epoch) term length.\n\n**Note 2:** Ratifying this governance action will remove the existing members of the interim Constitutional Committee: The Cardano Foundation, Input | Output Global, EMURGO, and Intersect. Cardano Atlantic Council, Eastern Cardano Council and Cardano Japan Council are members of the existing Interim Constitutional Committee, however have been selected to serve in the new committee. Cardano Atlantic Council and Eastern Cardano Council will continue to operate using the same cold credential. However, reflecting a change in its membership, Cardano Japan Council has generated a new credential for this new term.\n\n### Election Details\n\nIntersect\u2019s Constitutional Committee election working group designed the election process to be:\n\n- **Adhering to the Cardano Constitution:** Ensuring all procedures were compliant with the foundational rules of the ecosystem.\n\n- **Accessible:** Allowing any Ada owner to register as a candidate.\n\n- **Transparent and Verifiable:** Building trust through an open process with verifiable, on-chain results.\n\nThe election process ran from May 5th to July 6th, 2025, and included distinct periods for candidate applications, DRep voting, and a final audit. The voting tools were provided by Byron Network, and the results of the DRep vote were independently verified by DQuadrant.",
          "motivation": "The term for the current Interim Constitutional Committee is set to expire on September 6th (end of epoch 580). Therefore, this governance action is critical to formalize the results of the recent election and ensure a new Constitutional Committee (CC) is enacted in time. This adheres to the Cardano Constitution's mandate for staggered elections and guarantees continuity of the committee's function (Article VII, Section 2).\n\nElecting a new CC before the current term expires is essential to ensure the seamless continuation of Cardano governance and the ability to pass actions requiring CC approval.",

          "abstract": "This treasury withdrawal funds **BloxBean** **Java Tools Maintenance and Enhancement** which will provide the following services:\n\nBloxBean provides several essential Java libraries and tools for building applications on Cardano. These tools---CCL, Yaci, Yaci Store, and Yaci DevKit---require continuous maintenance and feature updates to meet the evolving needs of the Cardano ecosystem.\n\nTo meet the growing demands of this project, we require an additional full-time developer for the next 12 months.\n\nThe requested funds will support this additional developer, who will focus on the following areas:\n\n1. Ongoing Maintenance:\n\n- Ensure compatibility with new Cardano network upgrades.\n\n- Address bug fixes, performance improvements, and security issues.\n\n2. Feature Enhancements:\n\n- Implement new features based on community feedback.\n\n- Optimize the codebase to improve performance and scalability.\n\n3. Documentation and Developer Tools:\n\n- Expand the documentation with detailed guides, tutorials, and example code to assist developers.\n\n4. Community Engagement & Support:\n\n- Provide ongoing support via GitHub discussions, forums, and discord.\n\n- Engage with developers to understand their needs and ensure tools are optimized for real-world use.\n\nThis Treasury Withdrawal is submitted by Intersect on behalf of the vendor. The following sections; Abstract, Motivation, Rationale and Vendor Profile have been sourced from the approved proposal submitted by the Vendor as part of the Intersect budget process.\n\nThis treasury withdrawal funds one of 39 proposals to give effect to the approved budget info action for \u20b3275,269,340, administered by Intersect via gov_action1u9x73kwufaxa70lfy59g4ynwyrcsaxdcd0gxzzmh67s9fxq4j8hqqk2phgh. The information provided herein is intended to fulfill the spirit of the constitutional requirement for a treasury withdrawal info action by also providing the details of the proposed solution, alignment to the budget, and amount to be withdrawn from the Cardano Treasury.",
          "rationale": "### Project Solution\n\n- Long-Term Support: Ensure BloxBean tools remain compatible with future Cardano upgrades for a seamless developer experience.\n\n- Enhanced Developer Efficiency: Improve tools and documentation, making it easier for developers to build on Cardano using Java and other JVM languages.\n\n- Ecosystem Growth: Support the continued adoption and integration of BloxBean tools by Java developers, benefiting the overall Cardano ecosystem.\n\n- Open-Source: Maintain these tools as open-source projects, encouraging collaboration and contributions from the global developer community.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nThe BloxBean team has extensive experience in developing and maintaining Cardano-related tools for Java developers. We have been maintaining these tools since 2021 and have been active in the Cardano ecosystem for several years, ensuring the tools remain up to date and functional for the community.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledgebase.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",
          "motivation": "This proposal aims to solve the following problem:\n\nBloxBean has developed a suite of open-source Java tools essential for Cardano developers, including the Cardano Client Lib (CCL), Yaci, Yaci Store, and Yaci DevKit. These tools enable Java developers to interact seamlessly with the Cardano blockchain.\n\nTools like Yaci DevKit are also used by non-Java teams to quickly set up a local Cardano devnet for testing purposes.\n\nAs the Cardano ecosystem evolves, it is crucial to keep these tools up-to-date with the latest network changes, optimize their performance, and provide robust documentation and feature enhancements to ensure continued effectiveness.\n\nWhile BloxBean projects are supported by a small team of contributors, with the lead maintainer (Satya) being an employee of the Cardano Foundation, the growing demands for ongoing improvements require additional resources.\n\nThis proposal seeks funding to hire one additional full-time developer through BloxBean to support the maintenance and enhancement efforts for the next 12 months.\n\nBloxBean Tools Overview\n\n----------------------\n\n**Cardano Client Lib (CCL):** A powerful off-chain Java SDK designed for Java/Scala/Kotlin developers to build and submit all types of transactions to the Cardano Blockchain.

          "abstract": "This treasury withdrawal funds **OSC Budget Proposal - Paid Open Source Model for Sustainable Development** which will provide the following services:\n\nThe Open Source Committee in conjunction with the Open Source Office (OSO) seeks to enact a Paid Open Source Model for Sustainable Development in Cardano. A budget proposal of \u20b35,885,000, designed to ensure the long-term sustainability of open-source development within the Cardano ecosystem. This initiative will be managed by the Open Source Committee (OSC) pending approval by the DReps, and seeks to address the critical funding gaps that hinder the maintenance, security, and growth of essential open-source projects.\n\nThis Treasury Withdrawal is submitted by Intersect on behalf of the Open Source Committee. The following sections; Abstract, Motivation, Rationale and Vendor Profile have been sourced from the approved proposal submitted by the Vendor as part of the Intersect budget process.\n\nThis treasury withdrawal funds one of 39 proposals to give effect to the approved budget info action for \u20b3275,269,340, administered by Intersect via gov_action1u9x73kwufaxa70lfy59g4ynwyrcsaxdcd0gxzzmh67s9fxq4j8hqqk2phgh. The information provided herein is intended to fulfill the spirit of the constitutional requirement for a treasury withdrawal info action by also providing the details of the proposed solution, alignment to the budget, and amount to be withdrawn from the Cardano Treasury.",
          "rationale": "### Project Solution\n\n*The Solution: The Paid Open Source Model*\n\nThis budget proposal introduces a Paid Open Source Model to ensure that essential open-source projects receive structured funding. It includes:\n\n- A Maintainer Retainer Program to fund developers maintaining critical repositories.\n\n- Bug bounty and security initiatives to identify and fix vulnerabilities.\n\n- Developer advocacy and engagement programs to onboard and retain contributors.\n\n- An incubation framework to support promising open-source projects and help them scale.\n\nBy implementing this model, Cardano will create a predictable, transparent, and sustainable funding mechanism that supports long-term open-source development, improves security, and accelerates ecosystem growth.\n\n*Key Objectives & Strategic Impact*\n\n- Sustainable Open-Source Development: Funding for 50+ key projects via the Maintainer Retainer Program ensures continuous innovation and maintenance of mission-critical repositories.\n\n- Developer Onboarding & Retention: Programs like Cardano Summer of Code, Code For Us, and Developer Advocates provide clear pathways for new and experienced contributors to engage in Cardano development.\n\n- Security & Infrastructure Reliability: Investments in Bug Bounties, Incident Monitoring, and Tooling Sustainability safeguard the network and strengthen ecosystem resilience.\n\n- Commercialization & Ecosystem Growth: The Accelerator Research Program and Expanded Project Support Services transition promising projects from incubation to sustainable businesses.\n\n- Community Engagement & Governance: The OSC ensures transparent fund allocation, performance monitoring, and open participation for contributors across Cardano.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nIntersect is a non-profit member-based organization incorporated in Wyoming, USA. The team at Intersect represents a broad mix of experience and domain expertise, spanning open source, governance, infrastructure, fintech, and decentralized systems. Many of our team members are long-standing contributors to Cardano and are deeply embedded in the ecosystem - both professionally and as community participants.\n\nThis proposal will be facilitated and coordinated by Intersect, with the Open Source Committee and our dedicated Open Source Program Office supporting the execution.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the Constitution. Intersect will administer the contract on behalf of its members and in alignment with governance actions approved by DReps. This includes coordinating project delivery schedules, reporting progress transparently to our members and the community, and escalating any disputes to the Governing Board and membership for resolution in accordance with established procedures. Members of the elected Open Source Committee will provide the necessary checks and assurance on milestone acceptance.\n\nProject progress will also be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledge base.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",
          "motivation": "This proposal aims to solve the following problem: Cardano's open-source ecosystem is critical to the network's long-term success, yet it lacks structured funding to support its growth. Unlike other blockchain ecosystems that provide clear financial backing for maintainers, contributors, and security efforts, Cardano's open-source projects often rely on ad-hoc funding or volunteer efforts.\n\nThis has led to several challenges:\n\n- Unmaintained Core Infrastructure: Key open-source repositories, including those used by dApp developers and the broader ecosystem, lack dedicated funding for long-term maintenance.\n\n- Loss of Contributors: Without clear incentives, experienced developers leave for other ecosystems, making it harder to sustain projects and onboard new talent.\n\n- Security Risks: A lack of structured funding for bug bounties and incident response leaves Cardano exposed to vulnerabilities that could otherwise be proactively addressed.\n\n- Slower Ecosystem Growth: The absence of stable funding for new tools, developer education, and strategic project support makes it difficult to keep pace with industry advancements.\n\n*Why This Matters*\n\nIf Cardano wants to remain a competitive, developer-friendly blockchain, it must invest in the sustainability of its open-source infrastructure. Without structured funding, key projects will stagnate, developer engagement will decline, and security risks will increase.\n\nA well-supported open-source ecosystem ensures:\n\n- Reliable infrastructure for wallets, dApps, and developer tooling.\n\n- More engaged developers who have clear pathways to contribute and earn.\n\n- Stronger security with funding for bug bounties and incident response.\n\n- A faster-growing ecosystem where teams can build with confidence, knowing key tools and services are actively maintained.",

          "rationale": "### Project Solution\n\nA suite of core infrastructure projects aimed at advancing the technical foundations of the Cardano blockchain. These initiatives focus on novel, high-impact developments across key areas of the Cardano stack. In the months ahead, Tweag intends to collaborate closely with qualified suppliers, DReps, and Intersect to further shape the structure and scope of these engagements.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nAt Tweag by Modus Create, we offer a unique combination of deep technical expertise and strategic consulting capabilities, with a long-standing commitment to open-source and decentralized systems. EURL Tweag has been in business for over a decade, having started in 2013, and has built a reputation for engineering excellence across critical infrastructure projects.\n\nSince January 2018, we have been continuously engaged with IOG (Input Output Global) on a variety of initiatives within the Cardano ecosystem, including conducting audits and core protocol development. Since May 2021, we have also provided formal audits for the Cardano ecosystem, helping to ensure the reliability and security of mission-critical code.\n\nOur team has played a leading role in the development of Cardano's core infrastructure, including leading the consensus and ledger teams, implementing the Ouroboros Genesis protocol, and contributing to the design of Ouroboros Peras. We have been involved in nearly all aspects of the core Cardano node, giving us a comprehensive understanding of the system's architecture, roadmap, and strategic direction.\n\nBeyond Cardano, we bring deep, practical experience with Haskell, Rust, and a wide range of technologies used in polyglot projects, enabling us to engineer scalable, secure, and high-performance systems across domains.\n\nAs part of Modus Create, a global digital transformation consulting firm, we are backed by a diverse team of strategists, designers, and technologists who help the world's leading brands build digital advantage. Modus Create specializes in strategic consulting, full lifecycle product development, platform modernization, and digital operations and is an official partner of top-tier technology providers such as Atlassian, AWS, and GitHub. This global reach and cross-disciplinary strength provide our clients with unmatched capabilities throughout the full product development lifecycle.\n\nThis proposal reflects our ongoing commitment to advancing Cardano's mission through rigorous engineering, strategic alignment, and high-impact delivery.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledgebase.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",
          "motivation": "This proposal aims to solve the following problem:\n\nBacked by Tweag by Modus Create and a consortium of trusted ecosystem contributors, this proposal combines deep technical experience with proven delivery capability. It not only addresses current pain points but lays the groundwork for Cardano's continued success as a scalable, decentralized, and open blockchain platform.\n\nEach project targets a specific technical challenge within the core infrastructure:\n\n- Peras, Canonical Ledger State, and Canonical Block and Transaction Diffusion Codecs improve interoperability, clarity, and consistency across the ecosystem.\n\n- Conformance Testing for Ledger and Consensus, alongside Black Box Ledger Testing, ensures protocol correctness and future-proofing through robust validation frameworks.\n\n- Plutus Script Re-Executor and Block Cost Investigation provide practical tools for performance benchmarking and Plutus optimization, directly benefiting DApp developers and toolmakers.\n\n- The Genesis Sync Accelerator and Hoarding Node address network-level performance bottlenecks, improving bootstrap times and reliability.\n\n- The Cardano-node-emulator and History Expiry initiative contribute to better testing, debugging, and long-term node sustainability.\n\n- Collectively, these projects support developers, researchers, node operators, DReps, and governance actors by reinforcing the reliability, performance, and maintainability of Cardano's core systems.\n\nThe return on investment to the Cardano community is clear:\n\n- Faster network upgrades\n\n- Reduced onboarding friction\n\n- Improved protocol transparency\n\n- Better tooling for smart contract teams\n\n- More resilient and testable infrastructure",

          "abstract": "This treasury withdrawal funds **ZK Bridge** which will provide the following services:\n\nOur proposal is building a ZK bridge for Cardano, which we will deploy on the Cardano testnet.\n\nAs part of this initiative, we will define a communication protocol for the bridge, provide the full source code of the smart contracts on the Cardano side, and produce comprehensive technical documentation detailing the protocol between Cardano and any other isomorphic blockchain.\n\nWe will provide a circuit that enables a relayer to generate the ZK proof that a locking transaction was successfully added to the chain, which can then be verified on the receiving blockchain. This way, any blockchain will be able to implement a ZK bridge with Cardano, leveraging its newly added capability to generate such proofs. This allows for a variety of uses, such as moving assets outside Cardano just by providing the proof that they've locked an equivalent amount in the Cardano Smart Contract. The resulting bridge can serve as a generic framework for interoperability between Cardano and any other blockchain willing to implement the corresponding counterpart contracts.\n\nFurthermore, we will implement contracts in Aiken to mint assets on a Cardano-like (isomorphic) blockchain and deploy them on the Cardano testnet, providing a fully functional proof of concept. These building blocks will enable developers to create bridges between Cardano and other chains with minimal additional effort.\n\nThis Treasury Withdrawal is submitted by Intersect on behalf of the vendor. The following sections; Abstract, Motivation, Rationale and Vendor Profile have been sourced from the approved proposal submitted by the Vendor as part of the Intersect budget process.\n\nThis treasury withdrawal funds one of 39 proposals to give effect to the approved budget info action for \u20b3275,269,340, administered by Intersect via gov_action1u9x73kwufaxa70lfy59g4ynwyrcsaxdcd0gxzzmh67s9fxq4j8hqqk2phgh. The information provided herein is intended to fulfill the spirit of the constitutional requirement for a treasury withdrawal info action by also providing the details of the proposed solution, alignment to the budget, and amount to be withdrawn from the Cardano Treasury.",
          "rationale": "### Project Solution\n\nBuilding a zero-knowledge bridge provides several key benefits to the Cardano ecosystem. A bridge between Cardano and other blockchains would make it much easier for value to flow in from external ecosystems, increasing the liquidity available within Cardano.\n\nA zero-knowledge bridge, specifically, offers important advantages over alternative architectures such as optimistic bridges. In a ZK bridge, a single user action accompanied by a succinct proof of deposit is sufficient to release tokens on the destination blockchain. This eliminates the need for community-wide monitoring or challenge periods, significantly reducing latency and trust assumptions.\n\nAdditionally, by building a ZK bridge, Cardano positions itself as a more interoperable platform, capable of engaging with the broader ecosystem of zero-knowledge technologies. This lays the groundwork for future innovations in identity, privacy-preserving applications, and cross-chain collaboration.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nEryx is a worker-owned labor cooperative with almost 15 years of experience solving complex problems involving mathematics and software. We are a group of nerdy PhDs with a solid background in math and computer science. Our team has extensive experience in blockchain development, cryptography, and privacy-focused protocols, which gives us the expertise required to successfully deliver the project.\n\nAmong other things, we've been core contributors to the Lambdaworks library and implemented the CircleSTARKS protocol in GPU alongside with Nethermind. This involved implementing several ZK cryptographic primitives (field operations, polynomial commitment schemes, FRI protocols, FFTs), in different platforms and languages. Furthermore, we implemented a proving system based on the Plonk protocol. During this project we wrote a simple interface to design circuits. It included basic operations and conditionals that made the building blocks for more complex cryptographic primitives. We also developed a Plonky2 backend for Aztec's Noir, funded by the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nIn relation to this proposal, we have extensive experience in Aiken smart contract development, including previously funded proposals under Project Catalyst focused on educational and technical infrastructure for Cardano. We also wrote zk circuits for cryptographic primitives such as hash functions and elliptic curve operations.\n\nWe are active contributors to the ENCOINS protocol, currently deployed on the Cardano mainnet with privacy-preserving features. Currently, we are researching the integration of ZK systems with the EUTxO model.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledgebase.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",
          "motivation": "This proposal aims to solve the following problem:\n\nCross-chain interoperability remains one of the most critical yet unresolved challenges for Cardano. While the ecosystem is advancing in scalability through projects like Hydra and optimistic roll ups such as Midgard it still lacks a secure, trustless, and modular zk-based bridge infrastructure.\n\nCurrent bridges rely on centralized validators or multi-signature schemes, introducing major security risks---as demonstrated by numerous high-profile exploits in other ecosystems. Without a native zero-knowledge bridge, Cardano is unable to safely connect with external chains, severely limiting access to external liquidity, composability with other ecosystems, and the ability to scale horizontally.\n\nFurthermore, the Cardano ecosystem lacks a unified open-source toolkit for:\n\nOn-chain verification of zero-knowledge proofs\n\nSecure and efficient cross-chain messaging\n\nAsset wrapping and unwrapping under Cardano's native token model\n\nAnd trust-minimized interoperability with existing ZK-rollups.\n\nThis absence puts Cardano at a competitive disadvantage compared to platforms like Ethereum, which already benefit from multiple zk-based Layer 2 solutions and zk-enabled bridges.\n\nA modular zkBridge is not only critical to unlock interoperability---it also lays the groundwork for a future Cardano-native zkRollup framework, by enabling the testing and deployment of foundational components such as provers, verifiers, and state synchronization mechanisms.",

          "abstract": "This treasury withdrawal funds **Midgard - Optimistic Rollups** which will provide the following services: Midgard, which is a modular framework for deploying optimistic rollup Layer 2s on the Cardano blockchain, designed to enhance transaction throughput, reduce costs, and enable advanced decentralized applications.\n\nThis Treasury Withdrawal is submitted by Intersect on behalf of the vendor. The following sections; Abstract, Motivation, Rationale and Vendor Profile have been sourced from the approved proposal submitted by the Vendor as part of the Intersect budget process.\n\nThis treasury withdrawal funds one of 39 proposals to give effect to the approved budget info action for \u20b3275,269,340, administered by Intersect via gov_action1u9x73kwufaxa70lfy59g4ynwyrcsaxdcd0gxzzmh67s9fxq4j8hqqk2phgh. The information provided herein is intended to fulfill the spirit of the constitutional requirement for a treasury withdrawal info action by also providing the details of the proposed solution, alignment to the budget, and amount to be withdrawn from the Cardano Treasury.",
          "rationale": "### Project Solution\n\nMidgard has a tokenless design. All transaction fees on Midgard are paid in Ada, and every Midgard block is published to the Cardano L1. Where Hydra moves transactions offchain (and thus does not contribute consistently in fee revenue to the Cardano L1) Midgard keeps transactions on-chain but in a more compact form (ie. rolls up transactions offchain into a compact representation that is published on-chain, thus the name rollups). This means that increased economic activity on Midgard directly translated to increased economic activity on Cardano, this represents a significant source of fee revenue for the Cardano L1. Midgard does not have independent consensus or economic security, instead it inherits economic security and consensus from Cardano.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nAnastasia Labs is at the forefront of research & development on Cardano for over two years now. We have been involved in the development of nearly every large dApp on Cardano. We have made contributions to many of the core repos, and we actively maintain over 50 different open-source libraries, tools, and public infrastructure for Cardano.\n\nYou can read more about our work here:\n\n[https://www.anastasialabs.com/](https://www.anastasialabs.com/)\n\nFurthermore, Midgard is already in active development, and we have already made significant progress towards our goal of EOY mainnet readiness.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledgebase.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",
          "motivation": "This proposal aims to solve the following problem:\n\nWe have Hydra as our native state of the art state channel solution, we have partnerchains as our native evolution of sidechains, Midgard aims to be our native evolution of rollups.\n\nThe UTxO system is a match made in heaven for rollups. It allows us to build true L2 rollups that inherit maximal security from Cardano. This cannot be replicated in account based systems. It's not a coincidence that Fuel, the first general purpose L2 to receive a decentralization rating of stage 2 (highest possible) is UTxO based.\n\nFraud proofs for global state systems like Arbitrum and Optimism are extremely difficult to implement and very expensive and complicated to conduct onchain (and require multiple parties); this is why to this date despite spending millions in R&D neither of those protocols has working fraud proofs, and they all rely on centralized permissioned sequencers and operators.\n\nOn the other-hand, fraud proofs on Cardano are extremely straightforward and require only a single party (no challenge-response proofs) due to the local state properties of the ledger.\n\nNot a single blockchain has managed to achieve true permissionless general purpose rollups. At the end of the day, the top \"L2s\"in the blockchain space right now are all custodial multisigs. The Midgard framework is a first of its kind, in its capabilities to deploy completely permissionless rollups that inherit the full security of Cardano.\n\n- No centralized sequencer\n\n- No challenge response \"proofs\"\n\n- No custodial multisig\n\n- Permissionless fraud proofs (open to anyone)\n\n- Permissionless operator set\n\n- Deposits and withdrawals cannot be censored (inherits the full censorship resistance of Cardano)\n\nThis is all made possible by Cardano's unique local state EUTxO architecture.\n\nUTxO contention, small block size, local state, transaction determinism, all of these \"problems\" may have led you to question why these design choices were made.\n\nMidgard aims to show you that these are actually not problems at all. In-fact quite the opposite, they are extremely powerful properties that, together, provide unique value that simply does not exist in any other ecosystem. These are, in actuality, the core pillars that make Midgard even possible in the first place.\n\nYou cannot build Midgard on Ethereum, Solana or Sui. It is a protocol that is only possible on Cardano.",

The information provided herein is intended to fulfill the spirit of the constitutional requirement for a treasury withdrawal info action by also providing the details of the proposed solution, alignment to the budget, and amount to be withdrawn from the Cardano Treasury.",
          "rationale": "### Project Solution\n\nIn this proposal, IOE and its collaborators outline key core Cardano platform developments aimed at substantially improving network scalability, security, performance, and usability, while enhancing developer support.\n\nImplementation of these initiatives offers substantial benefits across the Cardano community, which collectively, enhance Cardano's technical foundations, enabling it to support a larger, more complex, and more active ecosystem:\n\n* **For the Ecosystem:** Delivers massive L1 throughput increase (Leios), robust L2 scaling (Hydra, Mithril), and positions Cardano competitively in new areas like AVS (Minotaur). Enhances overall network security, resilience, and decentralization. Fosters supplier diversity through knowledge sharing and modular architecture (Acropolis). The ROI stems from increased network capacity, utility, and attractiveness, driving adoption and value.\n\n* **For End Users:** Experience significantly reduced network congestion and faster transaction processing (Leios), near-instant finality for specific applications (Hydra), the convenience of paying fees with native tokens (Nested Transactions/Babel Fees), and potentially more predictable transaction inclusion (Tiered Pricing). Enhanced security measures build user trust.\n\n* **For Developers & dApp Builders:** Gain access to advanced tools for building more secure and efficient smart contracts (Plutus High Assurance suite, Plutus Core enhancements). Benefit from a more extensible and accessible node architecture (Acropolis), easier integration with L2s and light clients (Hydra, Mithril), and improved transaction capabilities (Nested Transactions). This lowers development barriers and enables more sophisticated applications.\n\n* **For Stake Pool Operators (SPOs):** Benefit from significantly reduced node operational costs (lower RAM requirements via Ledger-HD, LSM/UTXO-HD), enhanced operational security (KES Agent), improved network performance, potential new revenue streams (Minotaur AVS), and a potentially fairer incentive structure (Revised Scheme investigation). Mithril improvements speed up node synchronization.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nInput Output (IO) realized Cardano's vision for a secure, scalable, decentralized platform through a research-driven, phased delivery (Byron to Voltaire). Leveraging formal methods, functional programming, and rigorous engineering, IO produced key achievements including Proof-of-Stake, Ouroboros consensus, Plutus smart contracts, native tokens, and scaling solutions like Hydra and Mithril.\n\nIOE and its partners' involvement spans the entire existence of Cardano, and is demonstrated daily by its active development, support, and maintenance. Key personnel essential to this long-standing contribution are retained to continue this effort through 2025 and into 2026.\n\nIO remains committed to furthering Cardano's technical development, research and community engagement.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledgebase.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",

          "abstract": "This treasury withdrawal funds **Eternl Maintenance** which will provide the following services:\n\nEternl has been a reliable and community-driven Cardano wallet since its launch in 2021. It offers a secure, feature-rich experience across web, browser extension, iOS, and Android platforms, serving both everyday users and developers.\n\nMaintaining Eternl requires \u20ac30,000 per month.\n\nWe seek funding from the Cardano budget to sustain these operational costs, ensuring Eternl continues to provide reliable access to the Cardano blockchain for the community.\n\nThis Treasury Withdrawal is submitted by Intersect on behalf of the vendor. The following sections; Abstract, Motivation, Rationale and Vendor Profile have been sourced from the approved proposal submitted by the Vendor as part of the Intersect budget process.\n\nThis treasury withdrawal funds one of 39 proposals to give effect to the approved budget info action for \u20b3275,269,340, administered by Intersect via gov_action1u9x73kwufaxa70lfy59g4ynwyrcsaxdcd0gxzzmh67s9fxq4j8hqqk2phgh. The information provided herein is intended to fulfill the spirit of the constitutional requirement for a treasury withdrawal info action by also providing the details of the proposed solution, alignment to the budget, and amount to be withdrawn from the Cardano Treasury.",
          "rationale": "### Project Solution\n\nEternl addresses this need with a secure, feature-rich wallet available across multiple platforms. Eternl is a wallet for all Ada holders.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nEternl has been providing reliable wallet services for approximately four years.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledgebase.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",

The following sections; Abstract, Motivation, Rationale and Vendor Profile have been sourced from the approved proposal submitted by the Vendor as part of the Intersect budget process.\n\nThis treasury withdrawal funds one of 39 proposals to give effect to the approved budget info action for \u20b3275,269,340, administered by Intersect via gov_action1u9x73kwufaxa70lfy59g4ynwyrcsaxdcd0gxzzmh67s9fxq4j8hqqk2phgh. The information provided herein is intended to fulfill the spirit of the constitutional requirement for a treasury withdrawal info action by also providing the details of the proposed solution, alignment to the budget, and amount to be withdrawn from the Cardano Treasury.",
          "rationale": "### Project Solution\n\n### Tokenizing Home Equity on Cardano:\n\n- Haus will move its existing liquidity protocol onto Cardano's mainnet, allowing homeowners to tokenize and sell portions of their home equity directly to investors.\n\n- This will create an efficient and scalable real estate-backed asset class, providing homeowners with cash liquidity and investors with a share in home appreciation.\n\n### Launching HausCoin on Cardano:\n\n- Haus will issue HausCoin, a real estate-backed token enabling home equity trading at scale.\n\n- Investors will be able to buy, sell, and trade tokenized real estate assets, unlocking new DeFi use cases for real-world assets (RWAs).\n\n### Leveraging an Existing 30,000-User Waitlist ($4.1B in TVL):\n\n- Haus already has a 30,000-person waitlist representing $4.1 billion in Total Home Equity Value (TVL).\n\n- A fraction of this TVL will be onboarded to Cardano, driving real-world adoption of the protocol.\n\n### Building a Legal Framework for Compliance:\n\n- Haus will develop a regulatory-compliant framework for issuing and trading tokenized real estate in the U.S., EU and international markets.\n\n- Legal and financial structuring will ensure seamless integration with traditional real estate markets.\n\n### Deploying Liquidity Pools & Market Infrastructure:\n\n- Haus will establish liquidity pools to facilitate instant trading and lending of home equity tokens.\n\n- This will support DeFi integration, enabling real estate-backed lending, yield farming, and staking mechanisms.\n\n### Product Completion & Market Expansion:\n\n- Funding will be used to finalize product development, enhance the user experience, and integrate with key blockchain ecosystems.\n\n- Haus will drive market adoption through strategic partnerships, marketing, and investor outreach.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\n## Relevant Experience & Track Record\n\nHaus is led by a seasoned team of experts in blockchain, fintech, real estate, and technology, with a proven track record of scaling businesses, executing blockchain projects, and driving financial innovation.\n\n### 1. Leadership Team with Deep Industry Expertise\n\n**Siddarth (CEO)** -- A product and tech executive with $1B+ P&L and 20+ years as a real estate investor.\n\n- Turned around a $2B public company leading to a $6.4B private equity exit through product and engineering innovation.\n\n- Built a $500M revenue AI platform at Amazon.\n\n- Scaled (NYSE: PL) from $2M to $140M revenue, leading strategic acquisitions including Google's Terra Bella in a $2.8B exit.\n\n- Launched Microsoft Surface 3 ($0 to $475M revenue) and developed the first Android phone at Google.\n\n**Rakesh Pullabhatla (COO)** -- A financial and operations expert, blockchain specialist, and fintech/proptech strategist.\n\n- COO/CFO Consultant at multiple Layer 1 blockchain projects (Nodle, Astar, Oasis, Metallicus) and several DeFi and NFT ventures.\n\n- Director at Planet Labs (NYSE: PL) -- Led company expansion from 30 to 650 employees, growing revenue from $0 to $150M ARR, leading to a $2.8B IPO\n\n- Director at Boku (AIM: BOKU) -- Helped build a global mobile payments platform in 120+ countries, leading to a $500M IPO\n\n- Former Economics Consultant at Cornerstone Research and held product & operational roles at Apple, Textron, and Fortune 150 companies.\n\n### 2. Proven Execution & Market Validation\n\n- Developed and tested the Haus Liquidity Protocol, completing 36 tokenized home transactions with $20M in TVL.\n\n- Strong Product-Market Fit, validated by a 30,000-user waitlist with $4.1B in tokenizable home equity.\n\n- Early DeFi Partnerships, including promising conversations with MinSwap and other liquidity providers.\n\n### 3. Real Estate, Blockchain, and Legal Readiness\n\n- Haus is already operational, with $25M+ AUM, $20M TVL, and $150K ARR, proving its financial viability.\n\n- Regulatory compliance focus, with an ongoing legal framework for HausCoin (SEC reg D approved) and tokenized real estate investing.\n\n- Institutional & Investor Network, ensuring liquidity, adoption, and long-term sustainability.\n\nWith a track record of scaling multi-billion-dollar businesses, building blockchain protocols, and executing real estate tokenization, the Haus team is well-positioned to deliver this project successfully on Cardano.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledgebase.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",
          "motivation": "This proposal aims to solve the following problem:\n\nMany homeowners are asset-rich but cash-poor, lacking access to liquidity tied up in their homes. At the same time, investors struggle to find stable, appreciating, asset-backed alternatives to traditional stablecoins or volatile crypto assets.",

          "rationale": "### Project Solution\n\n####  Proposal -- The Ask\n\n- Fund NFTCDN to make it free for all Cardano builders for 18 months under an SLA contract\n\n- Cover operational & infra scale-up costs to deliver enterprise-grade Native Asset CDN\n\n- Enables us to provide our solution to the Cardano community for free\n\n- Removes cost barriers, fuelling innovation, faster development, and wider adoption\n\n$5.5m cost avoidance opportunity & ~39,000 dev. hours savings for products seeking to integrate native asset display -- removing barriers to entry, faster new product launches, improved end-user exp. & increased innovation prospects.\n\n#### Tangible Benefits ($5.5m cost savings | 39,000 dev. hours savings | >17x ROI)\n\n* Eliminate up-front infrastructure costs (~$100,000 per product) for native asset display\n\n* Accelerate product development by 9+ months by removing the need to build and maintain complex, scalable infrastructure\n\n* Immediate cost avoidance opportunity of **~$1.5m** and **~23,400 developer hours** across 15+ existing NFTCDN customers\n\n* Additional cost avoidance opportunity of **~$1m** and **~15,600 developer hours** during proposal funding cycle by onboarding at least 10 additional products\n\n* Maintenance & operational cost avoidance of **$3m** for 25 NFTCDN users during proposal funding cycle\n\n* Proposal cost of ~$320k with a **ROI of 17.20x**\n\n# ROI Calculations Breakdown\n\n- **Typical development cost of infrastructure to support native asset display:**\n\n- ~9 months / 1,560 dev hours\n\n- ~$100k (developer, PM, infra) per product\n\n- **Typical annual running & maintenance cost:**\n\n- ~$100,000 in salaries for labour (back- & front-end, networking, storage, cyber security, admin)\n\n- ~$20,000 infra cost (servers, hosting, licenses)\n\n- **Tasks avoided by using NFTCDN:**\n\n- Cardano node + DB-Sync + Other Cardano software setup & upgrades\n\n- Middleware for native Asset metadata parsing (CIP-25, CIP-68, v0.01)\n\n- Middleware for metadata error and edge case handling\n\n- Integration with IPFS, Arweave, HTTP, on-chain storage systems/protocols\n\n- Middleware for multimedia content optimisation\n\n- Security handling (e.g., malware in native assets)\n\n- Real-time monitoring pipeline of native asset minting & updates\n\n- End-to-end routing pipeline, including maintenance and updating\n\n- Regulatory compliance review & management process overhead\n\n- Performance, reliability, and redundancy infrastructure\n\n- **Savings for Current NFTCDN Users (15 active projects)**\n\n- Dev Hours Savings = 23,400 (1,560 hrs x 15 current projects)\n\n- Labour & Infra Savings = $1.5M in cost avoidance ($100k x 15 current projects)\n\n- **Savings from +10 new projects onboarded during proposal period (conservative est.)**\n\n- Adds 15,600 dev. hours and $1M in additional savings for newly onboarded projects into NFTCDN for duration of proposal (18 months)\n\n- **Savings for on-going maint. & ops cost (25 projects)**\n\n- Adds $3m in additional savings ($100k + $20k x 25 total projects using NFTCDN)\n\n- **Total value returned:**\n\n- ~39,000 dev hours saved for initial development\n\n- ~$5.5M total ecosystem cost avoidance\n\n- **Proposal cost:** ~$320k\n\n- **Estimated ROI:** ~17.2x\n\n- Equivalent of ~19 years of cumulative dev time saved\n\n####  Intangible Benefits\n\n* **Removes Adoption Barriers** - Eliminates financial (OPEX/CAPEX) & technical (dev. complexity) barriers to entry\n\n* **Accelerates Time-to-Market** - Enables fast and easy integration of native asset features/capabilities\n\n* **Frees Up Product Teams** - Reduces backend overhead, letting teams focus on core feature dev, growth & adoption\n\n* **Boosts Developer Adoption** - Makes accessible for early-stage, under/unfunded and community (free-product) builders\n\n* **Enables Broader Innovation** - Enables exploration of new native asset use cases (RWA, identity, media, education)\n\n* **Future-Proof Native Asset Delivery** - Adapts to evolving standards; all users benefit from shared upgrades and fixes\n\n* **Eliminates Redundancy** - Shared infrastructure avoids every project building redundant, costly systems\n\n* **Improves End-User Experience** - A high-speed, enterprise-grade, globally distributed CDN for multimedia content substantially improves loading speeds\n\n* **Drives Ecosystem Growth** -- Native asset adoption across more apps creates compounding utility and user adoption\n\n* **Aligns with Cardano's Goals & Roadmap** -- Directly supports Cardano's 2025 roadmaps goals around simplifying developer experience, increasing real-world utility and improving end-user experience\n\n# Aligns w/ Proposed Cardano 2025 Goals & Roadmap\n\n* \"Get More Usage\" Category\n\n* Goal: Attract DApps and users - product market fit\n\n* Goal: Easier to build on and to use Cardano\n\n* Goal: Cardano competitive option\n\n* Goal: Clear funding mechanisms\n\n* \"Developer/User Experience\" Category\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\n# About NFTCDN\n\n* Established in 2022\n\n* Testnet (Preview & Pre-Prod) and Mainnet coverage of all native assets\n\n* Service(s) offered on pay-per-API-use tiered pricing model\n\n* Existing customers include Verspr, Eternl, Tokeo, NEWM, NMKR, Pool.pm\n\n* Have served 800+ million API requests as of April-2025\n\n* Currently running with 100% uptime since launch\n\n# How is NFTCDN different from a basic CDN (e.g. Cloudflare, Vercel, etc)\n\n- **NFTCDN is purpose-built for Cardano**: NFTCDN is more than a CDN. Direct API access to `/metadata`, `/image`, `/file` native assets using only their fingerprint ID. Cloudflare offers no blockchain/NFT support; this would have to be custom built by devs.\n\n- **Multi-protocol/system support**: NFTCDN auto-handles multimedia storage fetching from IPFS, Arweave, HTTP, on-chain. Cloudflare requires devs to build fetch/parsing logic manually on their own infra setup.\n\n- **Standards-aware infra**: NFTCDN supports CIP-25, 68, v0.01 and adapts as they evolve. Cloudflare has no protocol awareness - devs must implement parsing module compliance manually and cater for human error and edge cases.\n\n- **No infra required**: NFTCDN handles full resolution flow (parsing, error fall-back, and format support) out of the box. Cloudflare needs origin setup and content pre-hosted on their proprietary solutions.\n\n- **Real-time chain indexing**: Native assets state updated live (minting & updating) from chain. Cloudflare requires manual indexing, pointer mgmt, and cache invalidation.\n\n- **Cloudflare TOS risk**: Large or non-web file caching (image, audio, video, 3D files) is restricted; in-production use will violate TOS unless using proprietary paid products (Stream/Images/R2, c. ~$5k+/yr).\n\n- **Global cross-app caching**: NFTCDN caches assets at the asset level, so cache `HITS` benefit all products (websites & dApps). Cloudflare caches per domain/site - no sharing resulting in low CDN performance resulting in higher cache `MISS` states.\n\n- **Built-in content safety**: NFTCDN provides CSP headers + dev. controls over rendering. Cloudflare lacks native asset-specific safeguards, increasing risk of suspension due to embedded malicious multimedia content.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledgebase.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",
          "motivation": "This proposal aims to solve the following problem:\n\n### Background - Native Assets\n\n- Native assets (NFTs & FTs) are widely used on Cardano across diverse use cases\n\n- Often used to store multimedia content - images, music, videos, documents, etc\n\n- Media is stored on decentralised systems - IPFS, Arweave, and on-chain embeds\n\n- Centralised storage options also used - HTTP, FTP & commercial cloud providers\n\n- File locations are referenced as links within the native asset's metadata\n\n### Pain Point - Technical Complexity\n\n- Accessing native asset media requires querying the blockchain (Cardano node + DB-Sync)\n\n- And fetching content via middleware (e.g. IPFS gateway/node)\n\n- Apps must handle this process programmatically, at scale, with robust exception handling\n\n- Developers face challenges from:\n\n- Human error (e.g. typos in metadata links)\n\n- Evolving standards (e.g. NFT v0.01, CIP-25, CIP-68)\n\n- Protocol updates (e.g. Chang HF impacting Node & DB-Sync)\n\n- Performance, efficiency, and reliability must be maintained across all layers\n\n- Apps must build and maintain complex, resilient backend infrastructure to support native asset display as both a capability & feature\n\n### Solution -- NFTCDN\n\n- NFTCDN is a managed Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) provider\n\n- Provides high-availability native asset media & metadata delivery via globally distributed, high-speed Content Delivery Network\n\n- Developers access content using only the native asset fingerprint ID - no complex setup needed\n\n- Eliminates the need to design, build, test, & maintain complex end-to-end infra\n\n- Enables focus on innovation of their product - not backend ops\n\n### Problem Statement - Cost to Build/Access\n\n- Building native asset delivery infra in-house costs ~$100,000 and 9+ months (internal benchmarks)\n\n- NFTCDN solves upfront CAPEX/OPEX needs\n\n- But we are a paid service (pay-per-API-call) - limiting adoption\n\n- Only well-funded teams have been able to integrate NFTCDN to date\n\n- Many projects cannot afford the cost, leading to delays, increased risk, or total shutdown\n\n- Market headwinds further impacted adoption, with some customers forced to shut down due to reduced user base",

          "rationale": "### Project Solution\n\nUnveiling the First Unified Global Events Marketing Strategy for Cardano. The entities will deliver 'Cardano' branded sponsorships at global conferences in 2025 and 2026, managed and planned by the events management experts.\n\nCardano as an L1 needs to be promoted as the brand at these events with no biased 3rd party business objectives hovering around it. They will run a 100% Cardano-focused events and marketing campaign globally at the most cost-efficient manner leveraging our wealth of event experience.\n\nList of Key Events: [https://ucarecdn.com/601623d5-e9ef-45ec-9025-1e7cd40f824c/External2025EventsListCleanlist_14April.pdf](https://ucarecdn.com/601623d5-e9ef-45ec-9025-1e7cd40f824c/External2025EventsListCleanlist_14April.pdf)\n\nUnveiling the First Unified Global Events Marketing Strategy for Cardano PDF:\n\n[https://ucarecdn.com/0830cd4a-dec8-4595-8a27-2a680788e90d/Cardano2025EventProposalUpdatedMarch.pdf](https://ucarecdn.com/0830cd4a-dec8-4595-8a27-2a680788e90d/Cardano2025EventProposalUpdatedMarch.pdf)\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nCardano Foundation: An independent, Swiss-based non-profit organization tasked with advancing the public digital infrastructure of Cardano and working to anchor it as a utility for financial and social systems\n\nEmurgo: EMURGO is a blockchain technology company and a founding entity of the Cardano blockchain that provides products and services to drive the adoption of Cardano's Web3 ecosystem. Established in Japan, EMURGO exists to facilitate commercial growth of the Cardano ecosystem and unlock the full potential of the ecosystem through partnerships, investments, education, and infrastructure development.\n\nRare Network: Rare Network is a premier event services, KOL (Key Opinion Leader), and marketing company dedicated to promoting businesses within the blockchain technology and Web3 space. As the parent group of RareEvo.io, Rare Network specializes in creating impactful events and innovative marketing strategies that drive visibility and growth for pioneering companies in the decentralized technology ecosystem\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledgebase.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",
          "motivation": "This proposal aims to solve the following problem:\n\nThe Cardano ecosystem currently faces challenges in establishing a consistent and impactful presence at global blockchain events. Catalyst-funded initiatives often operate under independent branding which rarely mentions 'Cardano' which dilutes the visibility of Cardano within the broader blockchain community. This fragmented approach makes it harder for Cardano to stand out amidst the competition.\n\nCompetitors like Solana, Aptos, and Sui have established significant brand recognition by strategically aligning global events with developer-focused initiatives.\n\nTheir series of hacker houses and hubs---typically held 3--4 times per year---have successfully fostered active developer communities and increased Total Value Locked (TVL) on their platforms. These events seamlessly blend ecosystems, attracting talent and partnerships across multiple chains while solidifying their reputation as innovative blockchain leaders.\n\nWithout a similarly coordinated and impactful event strategy, Cardano risks being overshadowed in a competitive landscape. A fresh approach to event planning is essential to position Cardano alongside top players and attract developers, partners, and enthusiasts from across the blockchain ecosystem.",

This enables Project Catalyst to be a more effective innovation engine as larger projects will not rely on Project Catalyst for funding.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nOur team is responsible for building and maintaining Clarity, a governance platform purpose-built for the Cardano ecosystem. Clarity serves as the user-facing interface for interacting with Agora, an open-source, audited library of smart contracts designed for decentralized governance and treasury management.\n\nWe have already deployed this infrastructure in production and actively maintain it. Our smart contracts have governed over $10 million in Total Value Locked (TVL) and are used by four DAOs, each managing six-figure treasuries on-chain. These DAOs use the same tooling and processes that CB DAO will leverage, including member-based voting, proposal submission, temperature checks, and treasury execution fully enforced by smart contracts.\n\nIn addition to our technical capabilities, we work directly with Cardano ecosystem founders and project teams on a regular basis. Many of these projects are already live on mainnet, and several have expressed intent to participate in CB DAO as members during the initial cohort. This gives us a direct line of communication with the builder community and allows us to ensure early DAO membership includes high-quality, committed teams aligned with CB DAO's mission and KPIs.\n\nOur team's combination of hands-on DAO implementation, infrastructure development, and builder community engagement positions us uniquely to lead the operational launch and ongoing management of the Cardano Builder DAO.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledgebase.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",
          "motivation": "This proposal aims to solve the following problem:\n\nThis proposal seeks to address the lack of dedicated, sustainable financial support and strategic oversight for functioning dApps that drive real usage, transaction volume, and Total Value Locked (TVL) on the Cardano blockchain.\n\nWhile Cardano has mechanisms for new protocol development and early-stage funding, there is currently no infrastructure specifically designed to financially support application-layer projects that are already live on mainnet and which are driving Cardano's current user activity. Without targeted support, these projects risk stagnation, limiting Cardano's broader adoption and on-chain ecosystem growth.\n\nTo reach mass adoption, Cardano needs to better support launched projects; this proposal aims to ensure that established builders with launched dApps can continue to build on Cardano.",

          "rationale": "### Project Solution\n\nThe Extended Quadratic Funding model doesn't replace Project Catalyst but complements it, bringing additional funding, greater participation, and enhanced accountability to Cardano's innovation ecosystem.\n\nWe propose a complementary funding mechanism that addresses these challenges through a combination of innovative approaches:\n\n### 1. Democratizing Decision-Making\n\nOur extended quadratic funding model calculates voting power using two factors:\n\n1. **Square root of donation amount** (e.g., $9 donation = 3 votes)\n\n2. **Logarithmic reputation score** (Impact Score) ranging from 300-850\n\nThis approach balances financial contribution with proven community impact, preventing wealth concentration from dominating decisions while maintaining skin-in-the-game principles.\n\nTo protect this system's integrity, we implement:\n\n- **Sybil resistance:** Zero-knowledge proof KYC via Hyperledger Identus (formerly Atala PRISM) ensures one-human-one-account without compromising privacy\n\n- **Anti-collusion measures:**\n\n- Reputation incentives that make system integrity valuable to high-impact participants\n\n- Penalties including reputation loss or platform bans for collusion attempts\n\n- Economic disincentives through fee structures that make vote-splitting unprofitable\n\n- Use [Connection-Oriented Cluster Matching](https://www.gitcoin.co/blog/leveling-the-field-how-connection-oriented-cluster-matching-strengthens-quadratic-funding)\n\nFor more information on formal proofs of quadratic voting and literature reviews, see [Kovalchuk et al. 2024](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hq_P_BEvXDhJcph6zmA0_CQHTcO0lyAZ/view?usp=sharing), [Ostrom 2010](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ej30QuyfcyCjNABd6O6S3MEk5Dy14WyL/view?usp=sharing), [Lalley and Weyl 2015](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EjZoN4Gcxjwb0Va0OuRgEgBYRVcgDiWI/view?usp=drive_link) and [Poster and Weyl 2019](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1E_tXBhMIO6WLeVVpv3J_AsicTiSKAUze/view?usp=drive_link)\n\n### 2. Multiplying Treasury Impact\n\nOur model transforms the treasury from sole funder to catalyst:\n\n- Individual donors contribute alongside treasury funds, potentially increasing available capital by 50%+\n\n- U.S. donors benefit from 501(c)(3) tax deductions, creating unique incentives outside the crypto ecosystem\n\n- Donations increase projects' chances of receiving matching funds, aligning individual and ecosystem interests\n\n**Example:** A $1M treasury allocation could attract $500K in individual donations, yielding $1.5M total funding while building broader community investment. Please see more details in the \"Why this amount\" section below.\n\n### 3. Standardized Impact Reporting\n\nAll funded projects must:\n\n- Contract with designated impact accountants (funded from project allocation)\n\n- Report standardized metrics including:\n\n- On-chain transactions generated\n\n- New wallets created\n\n- Active users acquired\n\n- Other ecosystem growth indicators\n\nThis creates the first comprehensive dataset of innovation ROI within the Cardano ecosystem.\n\n### 4. Sustainable Value Capture\n\nWe establish a voluntary contribution system where funded projects share value with the ecosystem through:\n\n- Equity stakes\n\n- Token allocations\n\n- Revenue sharing agreements\n\n- Carbon credits or other generated assets\n\nOur target is a 5% annual return within 10 years---an ambitious but achievable goal based on startup ecosystem standards.\n\nThe most reliable measure of VC fund returns comes from the Cambridge Associates US Venture Capital Index, which shows an 8.5% annual return over 10 years as of December 31, 2023. While this net return to limited partners reflects the overall pooled performance, typical median returns are lower, around 4-5%, due to the skewed distribution of returns.\n\nSources:\n\n- [Cambridge Associates US PE/VC Benchmark Commentary Calendar Year 2023](https://www.cambridgeassociates.com/insight/us-pe-vc-benchmark-commentary-calendar-year-2023/)\n\n- [Seraf-Investor.com Dividing the Pie: How Venture Fund Economics Work Part II](http://seraf-investor.com)\n\n- [Emmanuel Maggiori Venture Capital Returns: True Lies?](https://emaggiori.com/venture-capital-returns/)\n\n- [Founder Equity Fund The New Reality of Venture Capital](https://founderequity.com/the-new-reality-of-venture-capital)\n\n- [British Business Bank UK Venture Capital Financial Returns 2024](https://www.british-business-bank.co.uk/about/research-and-publications/uk-venture-capital-financial-returns-2024)\n\n- [EY Q2 2023 Venture Capital Investment Trends](https://www.ey.com/en_us/insights/growth/q2-2023-venture-capital-investment-trends)\n\n- [Jumpstart Magazine How Long Until a VC Makes Returns?](https://www.jumpstartmag.com/how-long-until-a-vc-makes-returns/)\n\n- [Cambridge Associates WEB-2020-Q2-USVC-Benchmark-Book](https://www.cambridgeassociates.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/WEB-2020-Q2-USVC-Benchmark-Book.pdf)\n\n### 5. Efficient Milestone Management\n\nOur streamlined process features:\n\n- Token incentives for prompt reviewer decisions\n\n- Financial penalties for reviewers whose decisions are overturned\n\n- Decentralized dispute resolution mechanism (detailed at: [https://socious.gitbook.io/whitepaper/decentralized-dispute-resolution](https://socious.gitbook.io/whitepaper/decentralized-dispute-resolution))\n\nThis creates a self-balancing system encouraging both speed and accuracy.\n\nThis is particularly beneficial for teams seeking small amounts of funding, who often struggle with Catalyst's lengthy milestone approval process.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nOur team is uniquely qualified to deliver this project successfully. We have the expertise and capabilities to execute with the highest standards of trust and accountability.\n\nOur extensive experience spans Project Catalyst, Singularity Net Community's Deep Funding, and GitCoin.

Mohammad is a Cardano community member for the past year.\n\nTo supplement our core team, we maintain a reserve of skilled freelancers, ready to contribute at short notice. Our talent marketplace, Socious, is a hub for over 12,000 individuals, many of whom could potentially assist in this project, if required.\n\nThe trustworthiness in our fund management processes is grounded in our serious adherence to legal and financial compliance. Each transaction conducted is meticulously documented with tangible evidence and audited internally for accuracy. To bolster our commitment to financial transparency, we have established collaborations with external accounting firms that assure compliance. We work with ([Tatsumi Accounting Firm](https://kessan-online.jp/company)) and ([BBCIncorp](https://bbcincorp.com/offshore/accounting-and-auditing)).\n\nAdditionally, we liaise with an external law firm,([Enlighten Law Group](https://www.enlightenlaw.com/)), to ensure full legal compliance. This meticulous, multilayered approach to fund management reflects our dedication to maintaining high levels of trust and accountability.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledgebase.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",

Project Catalyst stands out as a prime example, having fueled over 2,100 projects with more than $150 million, a clear testament to Cardano's dedication to decentralized innovation. Still, persistent hurdles across all ecosystems underscore the need for continued refinement in funding approaches.\n\nThe five critical challenges in blockchain ecosystem innovation funding: concentrated voter power, treasury fund limitations, inadequate impact reporting, uncertain ROI, and inefficient milestone management.",

          "abstract": "This treasury withdrawal funds **Beyond Minimum Viable Governance: Iteratively Improving on Cardano Voltaire** which will provide the following services:\n\nThis initiative will establish a robust framework for evaluating and enhancing Cardano's governance system. We will identify and benchmark key governance metrics to assess the health, performance, and overall impact of our decentralized decision-making processes. The resulting 'State of Governance' report will provide a structured evaluation of participation, track vital Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), map the evolving governance ecosystem, and pinpoint specific areas for improvement.\n\nTo ensure our findings are grounded in real-world experience, we will engage the Cardano community through various channels. These include virtual workshops, targeted surveys, and in-depth user interviews. By actively gathering and synthesizing community insights, we will gain a comprehensive understanding of the current state of governance. This will allow us to formulate actionable recommendations and pave the way for post-MVG (Minimum Viable Governance) evolution. Where appropriate, these recommendations will be developed into initial drafts of Cardano Problem Statements (CPSs) or Cardano Improvement Proposals (CIPs), directly reflecting the community's vision for a more robust and effective governance future.\n\nThis Treasury Withdrawal is submitted by Intersect on behalf of the vendor. The following sections; Abstract, Motivation, Rationale and Vendor Profile have been sourced from the approved proposal submitted by the Vendor as part of the Intersect budget process.\n\nThis treasury withdrawal funds one of 39 proposals to give effect to the approved budget info action for \u20b3275,269,340, administered by Intersect via gov_action1u9x73kwufaxa70lfy59g4ynwyrcsaxdcd0gxzzmh67s9fxq4j8hqqk2phgh. The information provided herein is intended to fulfill the spirit of the constitutional requirement for a treasury withdrawal info action by also providing the details of the proposed solution, alignment to the budget, and amount to be withdrawn from the Cardano Treasury.",
          "rationale": "### Project Solution\n\nImagine a Cardano where governance evolves continuously, driven by data and community insights. We will forge that future by moving beyond Minimum Viable Governance (MVG) to craft a dynamic, adaptable system with a clear, cost-effective process to pinpoint the real challenges faced by those who participate in governance. By putting this process into action, we will deliver transparent, insightful findings and expert analysis. Where needed, these insights will be translated into concrete proposals (CIPs or CPSs) reflecting community consensus. This initiative will kickstart ongoing governance optimization, empowering the community to actively monitor and address critical risks, ensuring Cardano remains a leader in decentralized decision-making.\n\n* The process outputs will be published including a state of governance report with measurement methods and workshop data with analysis\n\n* A playbook will be published with details about how to repeat the process and include lessons learned\n\n* Any CPS and CIPs will be authored by this team as a milestone of this funding, but the team will be open for other interested co-authors and collaborators\n\n* Further funding would be required to move a CPS to a CIP, or to implement a CIP\n\n* This could become a repeated process if the community finds value in funding these activities annually\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nThis project will be driven by a robust coalition of experienced stakeholders dedicated to the advancement of Cardano's governance. Input Output's Voltaire team will provide core leadership, leveraging their unique role as the architects of Cardano's governance framework. As the team responsible for implementing key governance mechanisms---including the Cardano Constitution, the DRep liquid democracy model, and various on-chain and off-chain tools---we possess strong insight into their performance and optimization potential.\n\n**Key Contributions from Input Output's Voltaire Team:**\n\n* **CIP-1694 Workshops:** Designed and executed community workshops that were crucial in refining CIP-1694, which is now implemented on Cardano.\n\n* **Constitution Drafting:** Led the design and execution of the global constitution drafting workshops, which led to the 85% on-chain approval of the constitution. Michael Madoff served as the founding Chair of the Cardano Civics Committee, Danielle Stanko was the Secretary and led the Constitution Ratification Working Group, and Thomas Upfield managed the delivery of global workshop and convention polling tools during this process.\n\n* **CIP Authoring:** Demonstrated experience in creating and contributing to Cardano Improvement Proposals: Thomas Upfield is the author of CIP-119, and Danielle Stanko is the co-author of CIP-120.\n\n**Broader Coalition and Community Involvement:**\n\nThis project will not solely rely on Input Output. We are building a broad coalition with active participation from:\n\n* **Constitutional Delegate Committee Members:** Ken-Erik \u00d8lmheim, Max van Rossem, and Tevo Saks, all experienced Cardano contributors, have committed to supporting this project, bringing valuable expertise as Workshop Hosts.\n\n* **Partner Organizations:** We have secured commitments from key partner organizations, including WADA and the Intersect Constitution team, to contribute to the project's delivery.\n\n* **Active Cardano Community Members:** We will actively engage with and draw upon the diverse expertise within the broader Cardano community, ensuring a truly collaborative and inclusive approach.\n\n**This collaborative model ensures a wide range of perspectives and expertise, enhancing the project's depth and impact on Cardano's governance evolution.**\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledgebase.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",
          "motivation": "This proposal aims to solve the following problem:\n\nCardano stands at the forefront of decentralized governance innovation. Yet, we face a critical challenge: the absence of transparent, data-backed frameworks to evaluate our governance's effectiveness, pinpoint obstacles, and drive impactful improvements. Without these structured processes, our governance discourse risks becoming reactive and fragmented. Potential risks may slip through the cracks, and decision-makers could lack the vital insights needed to refine our governance mechanisms. To truly evolve beyond Minimum Viable Governance (MVG) and unlock Cardano's full potential, we must establish a robust, data-driven foundation for continuous improvement.",

Our goal is to act as a trustworthy partner in assisting Cardano Web 3.0 projects by providing essential services such as Market Making as-a-Service (MMAAS) and helping with exchange listings. Through these efforts, we aim to enhance the overall liquidity and market presence of Cardano projects.\n\nThis Treasury Withdrawal is submitted by Intersect on behalf of the vendor. The following sections; Abstract, Motivation, Rationale and Vendor Profile have been sourced from the approved proposal submitted by the Vendor as part of the Intersect budget process.\n\nThis treasury withdrawal funds one of 39 proposals to give effect to the approved budget info action for \u20b3275,269,340, administered by Intersect via gov_action1u9x73kwufaxa70lfy59g4ynwyrcsaxdcd0gxzzmh67s9fxq4j8hqqk2phgh. The information provided herein is intended to fulfill the spirit of the constitutional requirement for a treasury withdrawal info action by also providing the details of the proposed solution, alignment to the budget, and amount to be withdrawn from the Cardano Treasury.",
          "rationale": "### Project Solution\n\nFlowdesk acts as a reference party that helps with engineering liquidity provision and listing of CNTs, assisting in:\n\n1- Exchange Listing Fee Pool:\n\nEligible exchanges are Kraken, Bybit, Okex and Binance (only top tier exchanges that are requiring new technical integration of CNT)\n\nBudget: Up to 1,500,000 USD (3m ADA at a reference price of 0.5 USD / ADA).\n\nNotes:\n\n- Top-tier exchanges might ask a listing fee > 500,000 USD. An indicative quote from one top-tier exchange would be around 1m USD of token allocation.\n\n- Not more than 500k USD (1m ADA) will be allocated for 1 CNT / Exchange.\n\n- Flowdesk acts as an actor of good faith to validate the budget allocated to a Cardano project for a listing.\n\n- Flowdesk does NOT receive any funds from the Intersect budget during this process (including no transaction fee, commission fee, etc.).\n\n- Flow for a Cardano project to request funds to get listed on an exchange:\n\n=> 1 Cardano project with a CNT\n\n=> Project agrees with the exchange on a listing offer\n\n=> Flowdesk Exchange Listing Criteria Assessment\n\n=> Decision\n\n=> If successful, exchange directly receives funding from Intersect for listing the CNT\n\n=> CNT is listed on the exchange.\n\n2- Market Making Fee Pool:\n\nEligible tokens are:\n\n-Non stable coins: SNEK, IAG, MIN and HOSKY\n\n-Stable coins: USDM, USDA, iUSD, DJED, KINKA (gold backed)\n\nBudget: 63,000 USD (126,000 ADA at a reference price of 0.5 USD / ADA).\n\nNotes:\n\n- Intersect > Cardano Project > pays Flowdesk monthly retainer for MMAAS business.\n\n- Flowdesk does NOT receive any funds from the Intersect budget during this process (including no transaction fee, commission, etc.).\n\n- Flow for a Cardano project to request funds for MMAAS with Flowdesk:\n\n=> Cardano projects\n\n=> Project agrees with Flowdesk on a MMAAS offering\n\n=> Cardano project receives funding from Intersect\n\n=> Flowdesk launches the MMAAS service.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nPartnerships already signed with major partners in the Cardano ecosystem:\n\n- [Nov 14th 2024 Snek MMAAS](https://x.com/CardanoFeed/status/1857081807109243353)\n\n- [Dec 9th 2024 Iagon MMAAS](https://x.com/IagonOfficial/status/1866147717564539258)\n\n- [Dec 14th 2024 DexHunter partnership](https://x.com/DexHunterIO/status/1867923226468233595)\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledgebase.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",

We will also be ensuring that projects that sign up understand the importance of pre event work, during the event work and follow up work to achieve the best possible ROI. The aim is that it will give projects a more affordable entry and education into how to truly make the most of exhibitions and marketing.\n\nThis Treasury Withdrawal is submitted by Intersect on behalf of the vendor. The following sections; Abstract, Motivation, Rationale and Vendor Profile have been sourced from the approved proposal submitted by the Vendor as part of the Intersect budget process.\n\nThis treasury withdrawal funds one of 39 proposals to give effect to the approved budget info action for \u20b3275,269,340, administered by Intersect via gov_action1u9x73kwufaxa70lfy59g4ynwyrcsaxdcd0gxzzmh67s9fxq4j8hqqk2phgh. The information provided herein is intended to fulfill the spirit of the constitutional requirement for a treasury withdrawal info action by also providing the details of the proposed solution, alignment to the budget, and amount to be withdrawn from the Cardano Treasury.\n\nNote: This withdrawal request has been reduced on request by the Vendor to avoid overlapping with other proposals being considered by the Cardano community - reduced from the Budget Info Action approved \u20b31,119,333 to \u20b3889,500.",
          "rationale": "### Project Solution\n\nThe funds will provide a partial subsidy to projects so they can afford to be present at exhibitions that will benefit them. Part of the funding will enable us to be able to provide support to the projects to ensure they get the most out of the event.\n\nThe Pavilions need to be paid for as far in advance as possible to ensure the best price and position is achieved. So the majority of the funds will need to be released upon successful application confirmation. But from a milestone point of view, the vendor will be providing proof that the event took place, along with follow up calls and KPI gathering.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nSupplyoneers FZ-LLC's proposer has 15 years experience at over 75 exhibitions and conferences around the world in various industries. They have also in the past benefited from Industry and Government Grant subsidy schemes for such activities.Supplyoneers FZ-LLC are employing the best fit here into the proposal for where they currently are as a young and developing ecosystem with very little marketing support to date.\n\nSupplyoneers FZ-LLC have previously had a largely self funded booth at a crypto event in 2023 as well as a satellite event at DIFC to the Cardano Summit where we gave 14 projects the opportunity to present themselves on stage in front of TradFi innovation teams like HSBC/Standard chartered and others.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledgebase.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",
          "motivation": "This proposal aims to solve the following problem:\n\nThere is a genuine need to get more of a Cardano presence at Exhibitions around the world, but the costs are prohibitive for many projects currently. Although everyone knows of \"Cardano\", they know very little, if anything about what has and is being built here or how to build here. We also need to attract more people to the ecosystem, whether its investors, developers or users. Exhibitions are often a key part of all of these audiences' decision making when choosing where to base themselves.",

The information provided herein is intended to fulfill the spirit of the constitutional requirement for a treasury withdrawal info action by also providing the details of the proposed solution, alignment to the budget, and amount to be withdrawn from the Cardano Treasury.",
          "rationale": "### Project Solution\n\nThe outcome of this proposal is a 2030 community-driven vision for Cardano, a 2026 proposed roadmap, and the first consolidated product research effort in Cardano. This will be achieved by providing clear paths for the broader Cardano community to participate in the 2030 vision creation process---both by contributing insights as key stakeholders and by enabling the collection of additional input through structured user and customer interviews, along with targeted product research initiatives.\n\nKey Outcomes and value this proposal will deliver:\n\n- Broad community participation in the first community-driven Cardano vision creation process\n\n- Documented insights from the community shared brain\n\n- Documented insights from key groups (such as SPOs, builders, and businesses in and outside of Cardano and Blockchain)\n\n- Participation in creating and critiquing the first draft proposal for a 2030 Cardano vision\n\n- Creation of the first framework and consolidated data set of insights coming from product research guiding Cardano (and builders on Cardano) on what are the most prominent user needs and the key market opportunities\n\n- Opportunities to access funding to run product research initiatives\n\n- Identify promising focus areas for Cardano to achieve product-market-fit, which can be coordinated with the Technical Steering Committee of Intersect to ultimately identify mission-critical Cardano feature sets\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nIntersect is a non-profit member-based organization incorporated in Wyoming, USA. The team at Intersect represents a broad mix of experience and domain expertise, spanning open source, governance, infrastructure, fintech, and decentralized systems. Many of our team members are long-standing contributors to Cardano and are deeply embedded in the ecosystem - both professionally and as community participants.\n\nThe Cardano Product Committee of Intersect is made of members' elected product experts with knowledge in business, market research, and user research. The committee is also supported by academic researchers and it will consult Subject Matter Experts to define research initiatives and allocate funds in an open and transparent process to expert providers, as well as to properly document and share all the collected insights.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the Constitution. Intersect will administer the contract on behalf of its members and in alignment with governance actions approved by DReps. This includes coordinating project delivery schedules, reporting progress transparently to our members and the community, and escalating any disputes to the Governing Board and membership for resolution in accordance with established procedures.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the Constitution. Intersect will administer the contract on behalf of its members and in alignment with governance actions approved by DReps. This includes coordinating project delivery schedules, reporting progress transparently to our members and the community, and escalating any disputes to the Governing Board and membership for resolution in accordance with established procedures. Members of the elected Product Committee will provide the necessary checks and assurance on milestone acceptance.\n\nProject progress will also be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledge base.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",
          "motivation": "This proposal aims to solve the following problem:\n\nThe original Cardano roadmap, set by Cardano's founders, ended with the age of Voltaire. Now it's time to define an open, shared, and transparent process for the Cardano community to define a long-term vision and a roadmap.\n\nCreating a long-term vision in a small group is not easy, and it gets more complex as more stakeholders participate. One of Cardano's strengths is its community-shared mind, so the challenge is to define a reusable process to leverage Cardano's shared mind to create a long-term vision for Cardano and make it operational.\n\nFurthermore, as Cardano advances toward a maturing ecosystem, its future hinges on informed decision-making. However, the ecosystem currently lacks a dedicated, rigorous, and consolidated product research function to guide these decisions across themes such as user adoption, developer onboarding, governance participation, competitive positioning, and broader awareness. This absence limits our ability to reliably measure barriers, understand emerging needs, and identify product-market fit opportunities.\n\nCardano overall, and builders across the ecosystem, operate without a shared, research-backed understanding of what users actually need or how to prioritize strategic direction. Existing insights are scattered or outdated, and there is no ecosystem-wide standard for how assumptions are challenged or validated. This creates the risk of fragmentation as well as solutions that don't address real user pain points or market gaps.",

The following sections; Abstract, Motivation, Rationale and Vendor Profile have been sourced from the approved proposal submitted by the Vendor as part of the Intersect budget process.\n\nThis treasury withdrawal funds one of 39 proposals to give effect to the approved budget info action for \u20b3275,269,340, administered by Intersect via gov_action1u9x73kwufaxa70lfy59g4ynwyrcsaxdcd0gxzzmh67s9fxq4j8hqqk2phgh. The information provided herein is intended to fulfill the spirit of the constitutional requirement for a treasury withdrawal info action by also providing the details of the proposed solution, alignment to the budget, and amount to be withdrawn from the Cardano Treasury.",
          "rationale": "### Project Solution\n\nThis proposal addresses the need for reliable ecosystem funding to support hundreds of Cardano builders and startups, alongside upgrading the core structural and operational limitations facing Catalyst, laying the foundation for its long-term sustainability and decentralization. Through these three interlinked workstreams: Catalyst Interface Development, Hermes Decentralized Infrastructure, and the execution of three Funding Rounds the return on investment for this proposal is measured in tangible, ecosystem-wide outcomes, including:\n\n1. **For the Ecosystem:** Significant reduction in operational costs, with potential savings of up to 50% in future Catalyst cycles from 2026 onward and broader and more meaningful community participation by strengthening Cardano's decentralized innovation funding infrastructure with expanded governance functionality and funding flexibility, with support for multiple voting mechanics and the ability to participate using Cardano Native Tokens beyond ADA.\n\n2. **For Cardano Developers, Entrepreneurs, and Community Builders:** Continued assurance of community-led funding, giving hundreds of community builders the confidence to plan and scale their projects, supported by a trusted, experienced, and committed Catalyst operations team. \u20b361 million to be deployed across three funding rounds, including the launch of a Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RetroPGF) initiative, designed to reward high-impact contributions that have already been delivered - even if not initially funded through a Catalyst vote. The results are increased support for early stage R&D, open-source, regional, and community-led initiatives, guided by more equitable and representative voting mechanisms.\n\n3. **For End Users :** Seamless, scalable, and accessible Catalyst infrastructure delivered through unified, device-agnostic interfaces lowering barriers to participation, particularly in mobile-first regions, enabled by enhanced user interfaces and experience and production-grade decentralized infrastructure powered by Hermes, replacing legacy federated systems with peer-to-peer architecture. The sum of these parts aligns directly with Cardano's broader goals of decentralization, transparency, and system resilience. Plus the introduction of optionality between delegated and direct voting that improves governance legitimacy, with greater transparency, auditability, and resilience across funding and decision-making processes due to investment in interfaces and infrastructure.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nThe Catalyst Team brings over four years of experience delivering the Catalyst program. Since 2021, the Catalyst Team has processed over 3 million governance decisions, allocated \u20b3290 million to 2091 projects from 114 countries in 6 continents, and operated 13 successful funding rounds with a well-established governance, compliance, technology, transparency and accountability framework. Catalyst's Fund Operations team has facilitated more than 12,000 individual payments to grantees, totaling \u20b3180,274,235 in addition to tens of thousands more payments for incentivised community roles demonstrating its commitment to operational and financial compliance integrity. The Catalyst technical team has pioneered decentralized voting solutions, including privacy-preserving voting, quadratic voting, and the development of a prototype Hermes engine in Cardano. The team remains committed to engaging the community to enhance the program's capabilities and to furthering Cardano's ecosystem growth and development.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledgebase.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",
          "motivation": "This proposal aims to solve the following problem:\n\nAs participation increases and the demands of funding and governance become more complex, this proposal aims to address five key challenges necessary for Cardano's continued growth, competitiveness, and decentralization:\n\n1. **Operational inefficiencies:** Catalyst currently depends on substantial manual oversight and coordination across its funding cycles. Without targeted investment in tooling and automation, operational overhead will remain high. Streamlining systems now lays the groundwork for a leaner, more cost-effective operation once this development roadmap concludes in 2026.\n\n2. **Low voter engagement:** While Catalyst sees higher voter engagement than most blockchain ecosystems, participation remains disproportionately low relative to the total ADA in circulation. This imbalance raises questions about how representative funding decisions truly are of the broader Cardano community.\n\n3. **Software limitations:** Fragmented tools and inconsistent user workflows create friction across the entire Catalyst journey - from proposal to review to vote to ongoing project-funding administration and transparent outcomes. This complexity deters newcomers and reduces the system's inclusivity and scalability.\n\n4. **Voting power concentration:** A small number of high-stake wallets have the potential to dominate decision-making, leading to concerns around fairness and influence. Planned reforms like Quadratic Voting and DRep delegation are essential steps toward more equitable governance.\n\n5. **Catalyst's early-stage focus:** While Catalyst excels at incubating early-stage ideas and pilot programs, its role is sometimes mistaken for a long-term funding source. Clarifying Catalyst as a launchpad for experimentation and industry adoption, while encouraging mature projects not focused on partnerships to seek alternative treasury channels---will help align expectations and optimize resource allocation",

          "abstract": "This treasury withdrawal funds **Blockfrost Platform community budget proposal** which will provide the following services\n\nBlockfrost is a powerful API platform that gives anyone access to the Cardano Blockchain and functionality without the need to run your own Node.\n\nOur API is designed with developers in mind, and offers tools that remove the complexity of direct node interactions, so anyone can start building on Cardano and launch projects on an affordable, stable and user-friendly framework.\n\nBlockfrost was originally developed by Five Binaries and is now maintained under the IOG umbrella.\n\nThis Treasury Withdrawal is submitted by Intersect on behalf of the vendor. The following sections; Abstract, Motivation, Rationale and Vendor Profile have been sourced from the approved proposal submitted by the Vendor as part of the Intersect budget process.\n\nThis treasury withdrawal funds one of 39 proposals to give effect to the approved budget info action for \u20b3275,269,340, administered by Intersect via gov_action1u9x73kwufaxa70lfy59g4ynwyrcsaxdcd0gxzzmh67s9fxq4j8hqqk2phgh. The information provided herein is intended to fulfill the spirit of the constitutional requirement for a treasury withdrawal info action by also providing the details of the proposed solution, alignment to the budget, and amount to be withdrawn from the Cardano Treasury.",
          "rationale": "### Project Solution\n\n**The Icebreakers**\n\nThe Icebreakers is a decentralized network of endpoints that allow developers to access Cardano data through a set of reliable node operators, instead of relying on a single centralized source.\n\nBy joining the Icebreaker program, SPOs and other Cardano node operators can monetize their existing infrastructure by processing API requests as part of the Blockfrost network.\n\n**Deliverables**\n\nTo ensure transparency and to prevent vendor lock-in, we are open-sourcing all components of the deliverables. This includes the infrastructure, libraries and documentation.\n\nOur primary focus is on two key projects: The Blockfrost Platform and the Blockfrost Gateway. Both are designed to expand the capabilities of the Icebreaker network.\n\n**Blockfrost Platform**\n\nThe Blockfrost platform is a next-generation backend designed to run on existing SPO relays, utilizing existing resources and rewarding operators with a share of Blockfrost's current revenue by serving our existing customers.\n\n**Blockfrost Gateway**\n\nThe Blockfrost gateway is the entry point for individual SPOs running the Blockfrost platform. Through the gateway, SPOs can receive requests from Blockfrost users. In return for processing these requests, they earn a share of the revenue.\n\nWith the Blockfrost Gateway, anyone can run their own Blockfrost instance with their own platform. We plan to use Hydra to open micro-payment channels between parties, enabling them to exchange ADA or other tokens for their services.\n\nWe are also developing the Solitary mode, which is designed for teams that require full ownership of their environment. Developers and enterprise customers can deploy a customized and independent Blockfrost instance with complete control of the infrastructure, uptime and security.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nBlockfrost is a powerful API platform that gives anyone access to the Cardano Blockchain and functionality without the need to run your own Node. Blockfrost aims to decentralize its Cardano Blockchain API through the Blockfrost Platform and Blockfrost Gateway, enabling a network of Icebreakers operated by SPOs and node operators to process API requests and share revenue. All components are open-sourced to ensure transparency and avoid vendor lock-in.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control.

All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",
          "motivation": "This proposal aims to solve the following problem:\n\nThe demand for a reliable infrastructure and tools that support development is what led to the creation of Blockfrost. If you have interacted with the Cardano Blockchain, there is a good chance you were interacting with Blockfrost in the background.\n\nBut this level of adoption has come with some trade-offs. At it's peak, Blockfrost was handling over 50% of all on-chain transactions on Cardano. We recognize this concentration is in contrast to the decentralized nature of the blockchain, and have actively been working to decentralize Blockfrost for the benefit of the Cardano community.\n\nTogether with Stake Pool Operators (SPOs) and node operators, we have started the initial phase of what we call the Icebreakers era, an incentivized program designed to decentralize Cardano data access and reward the incredible node operator community.",

          "abstract": "This treasury withdrawal funds **Hardware Wallets Maintenance** which will provide the following services:\n\n- Update Ledger and Trezor firmware and integration libraries with new relevant Cardano features or breaking changes. Update also if there are any breaking changes in Ledger and Trezor core firmware code, testing suites, etc.\n\n- Update cardano-hw-cli to reflect firmware changes and to reflect user needs\n\n- Support Keystone developers while doing the changes above\n\n- Provide general cardano hw wallets maintenance, development support and bugfixing.\n\n- Order and manage external code audits for Ledger firmware code (Ledger requirement, has to be done by one of 2 certified auditors)\n\nThis Treasury Withdrawal is submitted by Intersect on behalf of the vendor. The following sections; Abstract, Motivation, Rationale and Vendor Profile have been sourced from the approved proposal submitted by the Vendor as part of the Intersect budget process.\n\nThis treasury withdrawal funds one of 39 proposals to give effect to the approved budget info action for \u20b3275,269,340, administered by Intersect via gov_action1u9x73kwufaxa70lfy59g4ynwyrcsaxdcd0gxzzmh67s9fxq4j8hqqk2phgh. The information provided herein is intended to fulfill the spirit of the constitutional requirement for a treasury withdrawal info action by also providing the details of the proposed solution, alignment to the budget, and amount to be withdrawn from the Cardano Treasury.",
          "rationale": "### Project Solution\n\nIf implementation of new Cardano features and breaking changes is not completed then hardware wallets may become incompatible with Cardano, stopping users from accessing newer blockchain features or stop working altogether.\n\nIf regular maintenance, bugfixing and developer support is not completed, wallets may lack functionalities and development of tooling that is using HW wallets may become impossible or much more difficult.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nVacuumlabs has been developing the Cardano HW wallets integrations (Ledger and Trezor) since 2018.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledgebase.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",
          "motivation": "This proposal aims to solve the following problem:\n\nHardware wallets Ledger and Trezor and additional supporting tooling (cardano-hw-cli) need to be regularly updated in order to be able to support Cardano blockchain development.\n\nThere are 2 aspects of this:\n\n- regular maintenance, bugfixing and developer support\n\n- implementation of new Cardano features and breaking changes\n\nHW wallets in scope: Ledger, Trezor, Keystone (from support perspective as Keystone firmware and tooling is developed by the Keystone team)\n\nCurrently it is not known which features in Cardano Roadmap will affect hardware wallets integrations.",

          "abstract": "This treasury withdrawal funds **Pallas: Sustaining Critical Rust Tooling for Cardano** which will provide the following services:\n\nThis request for support focuses on Pallas (github.com/txpipe/pallas), a collection of Rust-native building blocks for the Cardano blockchain ecosystem. Pallas provides reusable components, such as cryptographic primitives and CBOR encoding, to enable the development of higher-level use cases like explorers and wallets. The project remains open-source, and actively welcomes contributions from the broader Cardano developer community. With 591 commits, over 430 pull requests, and 39 contributors, it stands as a strong example of open-source collaboration in the ecosystem. Pallas is being used by key projects in the ecosystem such as Aiken, Lucid, Mithril, Amaru, and many others. To ensure its continued evolution and maximize its impact, Pallas requires ongoing maintenance, updates, and new functionalities. We are requesting funding to secure the following roles assigned to the project: 0.5 FTE blockchain developer and 0.125 FTE tech lead.\n\nThis Treasury Withdrawal is submitted by Intersect on behalf of the vendor. The following sections; Abstract, Motivation, Rationale and Vendor Profile have been sourced from the approved proposal submitted by the Vendor as part of the Intersect budget process.\n\nThis treasury withdrawal funds one of 39 proposals to give effect to the approved budget info action for \u20b3275,269,340, administered by Intersect via gov_action1u9x73kwufaxa70lfy59g4ynwyrcsaxdcd0gxzzmh67s9fxq4j8hqqk2phgh. The information provided herein is intended to fulfill the spirit of the constitutional requirement for a treasury withdrawal info action by also providing the details of the proposed solution, alignment to the budget, and amount to be withdrawn from the Cardano Treasury.",
          "rationale": "### Project Solution\n\nSecuring ongoing funding for Pallas directly benefits the Cardano developer community by ensuring its continued reliability and performance as a key open-source resource for the Cardano ecosystem. Projects like Aiken, Lucid, Mithril, and Amaru already utilize Pallas to streamline development and reduce infrastructure complexity. By maintaining Pallas, we help developers focus on building applications rather than managing low-level blockchain details. This support strengthens the ecosystem's developer tooling, makes it easier for new developers to contribute, and fosters innovation across various Cardano-based projects.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nTxPipe is an active member of the Cardano ecosystem\n\nTxPipe has been developing open-source tools for the Cardano ecosystem for over 3 years and we're not going anywhere. Evidence of our commitment can be found by evaluating the continuous activity of our public code repositories.\n\nExperience developing in the Cardano ecosystem\n\nTxPipe has helped developed several dApps for the Cardano ecosystem. This experience allows us to evaluate the feasibility of the project and its potential benefit from a developer's perspective. We've also participated in development of chains using the released version of the IOG's Partnerchain SDK.\n\nSuccessful Catalyst proposals\n\nWe have successfully completed several Catalyst proposals. This may serve as evidence that our team has the required capabilities to fulfill these type of projects.\n\nDevelopment process will be public and open-source\n\nBoth the output and the development process will be public and open-source. This approach provides an easy way for the Catalyst team and the Cardano community to evaluate the progress at each step of the process.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledgebase.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",
          "motivation": "This proposal aims to solve the following problem:\n\nPallas has become a critical Rust-native foundation for Cardano development, providing essential blockchain primitives such as cryptographic primitives and CBOR encoding. However, maintaining an open-source project of this scale requires continuous effort---bug fixes, updates to support protocol changes, performance optimizations, and new feature development. Without dedicated resources, Pallas risks stagnation, which could impact the many projects and developers who rely on it. This proposal seeks funding to ensure Pallas remains well-maintained, up-to-date, and capable of evolving alongside the broader Cardano ecosystem.",

          "abstract": "This treasury withdrawal funds **UTxO RPC: Sustaining Cardano Blockchain Integration** which will provide the following services:\n\nThis request for support focuses on UTxO RPC [https://utxorpc.org](https://utxorpc.org) an interface specification designed to simplify interactions with UTxO-based blockchains. U5C defines standardized methods, data structures, and communication patterns. By providing a range of SDKs, and offering thorough documentation, U5C enhances reusability, interoperability, and performance in blockchain integrations. Currently in its early stages, UTxO RPC is already being adopted by key projects in the Cardano ecosystem, including Lace, Mesh, Amaru, and many others. As an open-source initiative, it welcomes contributions from the community, fostering a collaborative approach to improving blockchain infrastructure. To support its ongoing development, maintenance, and enhancements, we are requesting funding for the following roles: 0.5 FTE blockchain developer and 0.125 FTE tech lead.\n\nThis Treasury Withdrawal is submitted by Intersect on behalf of the vendor. The following sections; Abstract, Motivation, Rationale and Vendor Profile have been sourced from the approved proposal submitted by the Vendor as part of the Intersect budget process.\n\nThis treasury withdrawal funds one of 39 proposals to give effect to the approved budget info action for \u20b3275,269,340, administered by Intersect via gov_action1u9x73kwufaxa70lfy59g4ynwyrcsaxdcd0gxzzmh67s9fxq4j8hqqk2phgh. The information provided herein is intended to fulfill the spirit of the constitutional requirement for a treasury withdrawal info action by also providing the details of the proposed solution, alignment to the budget, and amount to be withdrawn from the Cardano Treasury.",
          "rationale": "### Project Solution\n\nSecuring funding for UTxO RPC ensures it remains actively maintained and continues to evolve with the Cardano ecosystem's needs. Ongoing updates, performance improvements, and new feature development will ensure the interface stays relevant and effective. This support will help simplify blockchain integrations, reduce complexity for developers, and improve overall performance, making it easier for new projects to adopt UTxO RPC. With continued maintenance, UTxO RPC can better serve the ecosystem and support long-term developer needs.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nTxPipe is an active member of the Cardano ecosystem\n\nTxPipe has been developing open-source tools for the Cardano ecosystem for over 3 years and we're not going anywhere. Evidence of our commitment can be found by evaluating the continuous activity of our public code repositories.\n\nExperience developing in the Cardano ecosystem\n\nTxPipe has helped developed several dApps for the Cardano ecosystem. This experience allows us to evaluate the feasibility of the project and its potential benefit from a developer's perspective. We've also participated in development of chains using the released version of the IOG's Partnerchain SDK.\n\nSuccessful Catalyst proposals\n\nWe have successfully completed several Catalyst proposals. This may serve as evidence that our team has the required capabilities to fulfill these type of projects.\n\nDevelopment process will be public and open-source\n\nBoth the output and the development process will be public and open-source. This approach provides an easy way for the Catalyst team and the Cardano community to evaluate the progress at each step of the process.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledgebase.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",

As the official maintainer of Lucid, Anastasia Labs is committed to evolving the library ensuring long-term support and usability for developers.\n\nThis proposal seeks funding to support ongoing development, maintenance, and ecosystem adoption efforts, including compatibility updates, feature enhancements, and developer documentation. By securing funding, Lucid Evolution will continue to serve as a critical tool for DApp developers, improving accessibility and efficiency within the Cardano ecosystem.\n\nThis Treasury Withdrawal is submitted by Intersect on behalf of the vendor. The following sections; Abstract, Motivation, Rationale and Vendor Profile have been sourced from the approved proposal submitted by the Vendor as part of the Intersect budget process.\n\nThis treasury withdrawal funds one of 39 proposals to give effect to the approved budget info action for \u20b3275,269,340, administered by Intersect via gov_action1u9x73kwufaxa70lfy59g4ynwyrcsaxdcd0gxzzmh67s9fxq4j8hqqk2phgh.

          "rationale": "### Project Solution\n\nThis project significantly benefits the Cardano community by providing reliable tools for developers:\n\nIncreased Efficiency, allowing developers to focus on building and optimizing their applications.\n\nEnhanced Quality: Reliable testing environments that lead to more robust and secure smart contracts, contributing to the network's overall health.\n\nDocumentation: Comprehensive guides and tutorials helping onboard new developers to our ecosystem\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nAnastasia Labs is at the forefront of research & development on Cardano for over two years now. We have been involved in the development of nearly every large dApp on Cardano. We have made contributions to many of the core repos, and we actively maintain over 50 different open-source libraries, tools, and public infrastructure for Cardano.\n\nYou can read more about our work here:\n\n[https://www.anastasialabs.com/](https://www.anastasialabs.com/)\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledgebase.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",

Hundreds of transactions can be submitted as a single batch, reducing the load on the L1. Cardano can achieve higher throughput and lower transaction costs.\n\nzkFold offers to build a general-purpose zero knowledge rollup solution for Cardano. A zero knowledge rollup is a technological layer (Layer 2) on top of a blockchain that increases the blockchain's scalability potential by compressing many transactions into transaction batches. As batches offer a greater degree of information compression, it is reasonable to expect that hundreds of rollup smart contract transactions might fit into a single Cardano mainnet transaction. Zero knowledge proofs technology places a limit on the cost of on-chain verification of the validity of transaction batches. Specifically, the batch verification fits well within the Execution Unit limits set at the protocol level, as demonstrated by the prototype created by the zkFold team.\n\nThis Treasury Withdrawal is submitted by Intersect on behalf of the vendor.

          "rationale": "### Project Solution\n\nzkFold will develop and implement ZK rollups on Cardano to scale it efficiently, promoting broader adoption and supporting an ecosystem of decentralized applications and services.\n\nOverall, the proposal will have the following positive impact on the Cardano ecosystem:\n\n- Improved Scalability: ZK rollups enable Cardano to process significantly more transactions per second (TPS) by bundling and verifying transactions off-chain. This reduces congestion, benefiting users by ensuring faster and more efficient dApp interactions.\n\n- Lower Transaction Costs: By reducing the number of transactions directly processed on-chain, ZK rollups lower the transaction fees, making Cardano more accessible and affordable, especially for smaller transactions or micro-payments.\n\n- Enhanced User Experience: Lower fees create a smoother experience for users interacting with dApps, decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, and NFT marketplaces.\n\n- Increased Adoption: ZK rollups can make the Cardano ecosystem more attractive for developers and users, promoting the growth of dApps, DeFi, and other blockchain applications by offering higher performance and scalability.\n\n- Maintained Security: ZK rollups allow for scalability improvements without compromising the security and decentralization of the Cardano base layer, as Cardano still plays the role of the settlement layer for the rollup transactions.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nzkFold team has successfully moving towards the TestNet of our ZK Rollup. The zkFold team consists of expert Haskell, Rust, and ZKP developers and Cryptographers.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract.

Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR.

          "abstract": "This treasury withdrawal funds **Dolos: Sustaining a Lightweight Cardano Data Node** which will provide the following services:\n\nThis request for support focuses on Dolos [https://dolos.txpipe.io/](https://dolos.txpipe.io/) a lightweight Cardano data node, designed as a backend for dApps. It is fine-tuned to solve a very narrow scope: keeping an updated copy of the ledger and replying to queries from trusted clients. Unlike a full Cardano node, Dolos is optimized for minimal resource usage while maintaining high data integrity and responsiveness. As an open-source project, Dolos has been steadily growing in adoption, with 366 commits, 367 pull requests, and contributions from 21 developers. It is becoming a key tool for projects seeking efficient blockchain data access without the overhead of full-node infrastructure. To ensure Dolos continues to evolve alongside Cardano's ecosystem, we are requesting funding for the following roles: 0.5 FTE Blockchain Developer and 0.125 FTE Tech Lead.\n\nThis Treasury Withdrawal is submitted by Intersect on behalf of the vendor. The following sections; Abstract, Motivation, Rationale and Vendor Profile have been sourced from the approved proposal submitted by the Vendor as part of the Intersect budget process.\n\nThis treasury withdrawal funds one of 39 proposals to give effect to the approved budget info action for \u20b3275,269,340, administered by Intersect via gov_action1u9x73kwufaxa70lfy59g4ynwyrcsaxdcd0gxzzmh67s9fxq4j8hqqk2phgh. The information provided herein is intended to fulfill the spirit of the constitutional requirement for a treasury withdrawal info action by also providing the details of the proposed solution, alignment to the budget, and amount to be withdrawn from the Cardano Treasury.",
          "rationale": "### Project Solution\n\nSecuring funding for Dolos will ensure its continued maintenance, optimization, and feature expansion, directly benefiting projects that rely on fast and lightweight access to Cardano ledger data. Continued improvements will enhance performance, reduce infrastructure overhead, and support a broader range of use cases. By keeping Dolos actively maintained, the Cardano developer community gains a robust and efficient alternative to traditional node setups, lowering operational costs and improving blockchain data accessibility.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nTxPipe is an active member of the Cardano ecosystem\n\nTxPipe has been developing open-source tools for the Cardano ecosystem for over 3 years and we're not going anywhere. Evidence of our commitment can be found by evaluating the continuous activity of our public code repositories.\n\nExperience developing in the Cardano ecosystem\n\nTxPipe has helped developed several dApps for the Cardano ecosystem. This experience allows us to evaluate the feasibility of the project and its potential benefit from a developer's perspective. We've also participated in development of chains using the released version of the IOG's Partnerchain SDK.\n\nSuccessful Catalyst proposals\n\nWe have successfully completed several Catalyst proposals. This may serve as evidence that our team has the required capabilities to fulfill these type of projects.\n\nDevelopment process will be public and open-source\n\nBoth the output and the development process will be public and open-source. This approach provides an easy way for the Catalyst team and the Cardano community to evaluate the progress at each step of the process.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect.

All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",
          "motivation": "This proposal aims to solve the following problem:\n\nDolos is a specialized Cardano data node designed to maintain an updated copy of the ledger and respond efficiently to queries. Optimized for data integrity and speed, it provides developers with reliable blockchain data access while requiring a fraction of the resources of a full node. Over the past year, Dolos has gained adoption within the Cardano ecosystem, with an active open-source community contributing to its growth. To continue improving its efficiency, maintaining compatibility with Cardano upgrades, and expanding its capabilities, ongoing development and maintenance are necessary. This proposal seeks funding to ensure Dolos remains actively supported, optimized, and available for the growing number of projects relying on it.",

Implement new UI into the Cardano Ledger App. Pass the external audit process (costs for this shall be included in proposal). Support the Ledger team by the release process.\n\nThis Treasury Withdrawal is submitted by Intersect on behalf of the vendor. The following sections; Abstract, Motivation, Rationale and Vendor Profile have been sourced from the approved proposal submitted by the Vendor as part of the Intersect budget process.\n\nThis treasury withdrawal funds one of 39 proposals to give effect to the approved budget info action for \u20b3275,269,340, administered by Intersect via gov_action1u9x73kwufaxa70lfy59g4ynwyrcsaxdcd0gxzzmh67s9fxq4j8hqqk2phgh. The information provided herein is intended to fulfill the spirit of the constitutional requirement for a treasury withdrawal info action by providing the details of the proposed solution, alignment to the budget, and amount to be withdrawn from the Cardano Treasury.",
          "rationale": "### Project Solution\n\nLedger wallet users will have better Cardano experience. Further app updates and releases will be faster and cheaper due to Ledger testing suite compatibility.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nVacuumlabs is a technology company founded in 2013, specializing in fintech product engineering, including blockchain solutions. Within the Cardano ecosystem, they are a significant contributor, known for co-developing the AdaLite and Yoroi wallets, and contributing to Ledger and Trezor hardware wallet support for Cardano. They also incubated and launched WingRiders, a decentralized exchange (DEX) that became a leading platform on Cardano. Furthermore, Vacuumlabs actively engages in smart contract auditing and provides blockchain consulting services for fintech companies looking to integrate with Cardano.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledgebase.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",
          "motivation": "This proposal aims to solve the following problem:\n\nIn 2018 when Ledger Cardano App was developed, there was no standard for embedded app UI. Over the years this changed and now Cardano is the only Ledger application with non-standard UI such as requiring double-click several times during the confirmation process. This is causing confusion among users and problems with testing because the design is not compatible with the testing suite.",

The information provided herein is intended to fulfill the spirit of the constitutional requirement for a treasury withdrawal info action by also providing the details of the proposed solution, alignment to the budget, and amount to be withdrawn from the Cardano Treasury.",
          "rationale": "### Project Solution\n\nIntegrating Maestro's infrastructure to enable Cardano as the smart contract layer for Bitcoin would generate substantial benefits across several layers of the Cardano developer ecosystem:\n\n1. Cardano DeFi Developers:\n\nDevelopers of DeFi applications (such as lending protocols like Fluidtokens) will gain immediate access to Bitcoin's immense liquidity pool, significantly expanding their potential user base and TVL. Maestro's integration enables developers to tap directly into Bitcoin's economic activity, dramatically increasing capital efficiency and profitability. Demonstrated value includes:\n\n- Significant growth in TVL, user engagement, and protocol revenues.\n\n- Easier user onboarding from Bitcoin-native communities.\n\n2. Wallet Developers (Tokeo, Begin, Lace, etc.):\n\nWallet applications will benefit from vastly expanded user functionality. By supporting direct Bitcoin-to-Cardano interactions, wallets can offer their users advanced features like Bitcoin-backed lending, staking, governance, and seamless cross-chain payments. Demonstrated value includes:\n\n- Increased wallet adoption and user retention.\n\n- Expanded revenue streams through cross-chain transaction fees and premium DeFi services.\n\n3. Layer 2 Solutions and Protocols (Midgard, Sundial, zkFold, BitcoinOS, Midnight):\n\nCardano's Layer 2 ecosystems will benefit by directly integrating with Bitcoin's user base. L2 solutions gain additional utility and liquidity, allowing their technologies (privacy layers, zero-knowledge rollups, sidechains) to achieve broader adoption and market validation. Demonstrated value includes:\n\n- Accelerated adoption and developer traction for L2 solutions.\n\n- Enabling innovative financial products and privacy-oriented services previously unavailable to Bitcoin holders.\n\n4. Cardano Ecosystem Overall:\n\nThe direct Bitcoin integration positions Cardano uniquely in the broader blockchain landscape. It would transform Cardano into the default execution and innovation layer for Bitcoin DeFi, attracting both institutional and retail adoption. Demonstrated value includes:\n\n- Enhanced market positioning as the leading decentralized finance ecosystem linked to Bitcoin.\n\n- Substantial increase in ecosystem visibility, credibility, and investment inflows.\n\nUltimately, the proposed integration presents Cardano with an opportunity to become the primary hub for Bitcoin's smart contract innovation and DeFi, unlocking extensive economic value, developer growth, and cross-chain collaboration.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nMaestro has a proven track record of delivering high-performance infrastructure and developer tooling for UTXO-based blockchains, including extensive experience within the Cardano ecosystem. Maestro's platform already supports various high-profile Cardano projects and integrations, successfully handling millions of transactions and servicing numerous applications across DeFi, wallets, analytics, and Layer-2 scaling solutions. The Maestro team comprises seasoned blockchain engineers and industry experts with deep technical expertise in indexing, transaction management, and API development, demonstrating a commitment to high reliability, security, and scalability in enterprise-grade blockchain solutions.\n\nMaestro already supports numerous Cardano projects expanding into Bitcoin (e.g., Fluidtokens lending protocol, Tokeo Wallet, Begin Wallet, Lace Wallet) and Cardano L2s like Midgard, Sundial, zkFold, and BitcoinOS. Recent support for Midnight further expands these possibilities, enabling private DeFi transactions anchored by Bitcoin's economic security.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledgebase.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",
          "motivation": "This proposal aims to solve the following problem:\n\nMaestro will help make Cardano the smart contract layer for Bitcoin.\n\nCurrently, Bitcoin faces inherent limitations in supporting DeFi and advanced smart contracts due to its minimal scripting capabilities and simpler UTXO model. Meanwhile, Cardano, despite being a highly capable smart contract platform leveraging an extended UTXO (EUTXO) model, struggles with attracting Bitcoin's substantial liquidity and integrating directly with Bitcoin's massive economic ecosystem. Without seamless interoperability, both blockchains remain limited: Bitcoin as a largely static asset store and Cardano without access to Bitcoin's immense capital pool and user base. Maestro seeks to address this by bridging the two ecosystems---leveraging Cardano's superior smart contract capabilities to unleash Bitcoin's latent liquidity, thus creating a robust decentralized financial layer powered by Bitcoin's underlying asset security.",

          "rationale": "### Project Solution\n\nThe goal is to have a fully functional light node that can run in the browser and can be integrated in dApps and wallets.\n\n- Users, trustless and more scalable applications\n\n- Experienced developers, local nodes means less infrastructure and easier access to Cardano\n\n- New developers, a familiar source code means more resources to understand what Cardano does\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\n[https://github.com/HarmonicLabs](https://github.com/HarmonicLabs)\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledgebase.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",
          "motivation": "A Typescript node would benefit the ecosystem in many ways:\n\n- Remove the ivory tower: make it easier for new developers to understand the protocol internals and contribute to the growth of Cardano.\n\n- Truly decentralized applications: every application that wants to interact with cardano needs access to a cardano node somewhere. without a local node (that requires technical expertise and is usually resource intensive) the only solution adopted is to have a centralized server hosting a node that clients access. a light node in the browser would allow everyone trustless access to the Cardano protocol in the most secure and decentralized way.",

The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledgebase.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",
          "motivation": "This proposal aims to solve the following problem:\n\nAs a core production-grade tool for Cardano smart contracts, Plutarch requires consistent upkeep and enhancements to align with network growth and upcoming hardforks. This proposal addresses the need for dedicated funding to maintain Plutarch's resilience, add features, and ensure ongoing compatibility, supporting developers and strengthening the ecosystem.

          "rationale": "### Project Solution\n\n(1) Benefits for professionals\n\nScalus meets developers where they are. It bridges Web2 engineers from traditional firms with progressive onboarding and built-in safety, while giving seasoned Cardano builders advanced control and optimisations.\n\nWeb 2 developers:\n\n- Familiar dev experience & tooling using Scala\n\n- Elegant syntax with gentle learning curve of blockchain specifics\n\n- Built-in safety controls to reduce common mistakes and risks\n\nCardano builders / R&D Labs:\n\n- Low-level optimisations (memory, cost, advanced patterns)\n\n- Expressiveness beyond limited DSL\n\n- Advanced features (macros, meta-programming)\n\n- Rich Scala ecosystem for complex protocols and mission-critical solutions\n\n(2) Benefits for businesses\n\nScalus, paired with Scala 3, helps businesses build on Cardano without the usual headaches. It's a practical way to deliver value quickly and reliably.\n\nBenefits:\n\n- Productivity boost at scale with Scala 3\n\n- Reduced time-to-market - from prototyping to production in less time\n\n- Deep pool of Scala/Java/Kotlin talent available on the market\n\n- Code quality and safety are first-class citizens\n\n- Reduced training investments to transition Scala/Java/Kotlin teams to blockchain\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nOleksandr Nemish is a seasoned software engineer with a specialised focus on functional programming, type theory, meta-programming, compilers, and blockchains. His expertise is underscored by his proficiency in languages such as Scala, Haskell and Rust.\n\nOleksandr has a robust professional background, having worked for prominent financial organisations like Deutsche Bank and UBS.\n\nOleksandr Nemish is a former engineer at IOG, the engineering company behind the Cardano blockchain. He worked on the design and implementation of Marlowe -- a new financial smart contracts programming language for Cardano.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract.

          "motivation": "This proposal aims to solve the following problem:\n\nBuilding DApps on Cardano remains harder than it should be. New developers need to invest a substantial amount of time to become productive. It makes Cardano less attractive to build on, and limits the ability to innovate and produce value to end users.\n\nNew developers face multiple obstacles:\n\n1. Steep technical learning curve\n\n2. Fragmented technology stack (on-chain/off-chain, front-end/back-end)\n\n3. Limited development tooling and standard libraries\n\n4. Scattered educational resources\n\nIn anticipation of the wider adoption of Cardano technology by traditional organisations (e.g., in finance and fintech, where Java and Scala are dominant), it should be simpler for their web2 developers to start building on Cardano. Companies need a smooth path for their existing teams --- without the need to learn new programming languages or hire specialists just to get started.",

          "abstract": "This treasury withdrawal funds **Cexplorer.io -- Developer-Focused Blockchain Explorer for Cardano** which will provide the following services:\n\nCexplorer.io is a high-performance, feature-rich blockchain explorer designed specifically for the Cardano ecosystem. It offers deep on-chain insights, real-time data access, and powerful tools for developers, stake pool operators, and users. With over 50,000 monthly users and millions of processed data requests, Cexplorer.io has become a trusted resource in the Cardano community.\n\nThis proposal seeks funding to ensure the long-term sustainability of the platform through infrastructure maintenance and continuous improvement. It includes two key areas:\n\nBAU/Maintenance -- Covering costs for server infrastructure, backend/frontend development, and bug fixes to ensure stability, uptime, and security.\n\nEnhancements & New Features -- Expanding the team with additional developers and a UI designer to deliver a better user experience, improved performance, and new developer-oriented features.\n\nOur mission is to provide a scalable, developer-friendly explorer that empowers the Cardano community with transparent, accessible, and actionable data. By supporting this proposal, Intersect and the broader community invest in critical infrastructure that enhances transparency, encourages innovation, and reduces friction for anyone building on or interacting with Cardano.\n\nThis Treasury Withdrawal is submitted by Intersect on behalf of the vendor. The following sections; Abstract, Motivation, Rationale and Vendor Profile have been sourced from the approved proposal submitted by the Vendor as part of the Intersect budget process.\n\nThis treasury withdrawal funds one of 39 proposals to give effect to the approved budget info action for \u20b3275,269,340, administered by Intersect via gov_action1u9x73kwufaxa70lfy59g4ynwyrcsaxdcd0gxzzmh67s9fxq4j8hqqk2phgh. The information provided herein is intended to fulfill the spirit of the constitutional requirement for a treasury withdrawal info action by also providing the details of the proposed solution, alignment to the budget, and amount to be withdrawn from the Cardano Treasury.",
          "rationale": "### Project Solution\n\nCexplorer.io serves over 50,000 monthly users and processes millions of data requests, providing real-time, in-depth insights into Cardano's blockchain. It supports developers, SPOs, researchers, and everyday users with tools for exploring transactions, addresses, tokens, and stake pools. By improving transparency and accessibility, it reduces friction in dApp development, stake pool monitoring, and ecosystem analysis. The return on investment is a proven, high-traffic platform that continuously evolves to meet the growing demands of the Cardano community.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nCexplorer.io (formerly Adapools) has been live since 2020, serving over 50,000 monthly users and handling millions of data requests each month.\n\n- The team has strong experience in backend systems, frontend development, API design, and DevOps, specifically tailored to Cardano's architecture (e.g., DB-Sync, Cardano Node, CIPs).\n\n- Proven ability to maintain high availability, fast performance, and implement continuous improvements based on real user feedback.\n\n- The team is fully equipped to ensure long-term support, stability, and delivery of new features in a rapidly evolving ecosystem.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledgebase.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",
          "motivation": "This proposal aims to solve the following problem:\n\nThe Cardano ecosystem lacks a powerful, developer-friendly explorer with advanced features, real-time insights, and flexible tools for building on-chain apps. Cexplorer.io aims to fill this gap by providing deep data access, improved UX, and ongoing enhancements to support the growing needs of users and developers.",

          "abstract": "This treasury withdrawal funds **AdaStat.net Cardano blockchain explorer** which will provide the following services:\n\nWe propose to continue development and support of the AdaStat.net Cardano blockchain explorer for the next 24 months. Planned work includes performance optimizations, improvements to UX/UI, and new features related to Cardano's evolving governance model and on-chain tooling.\n\nThe frontend is developed using Vue.js and Tailwind CSS, which allows very small bundle size and fast loading time on different devices. The backend is built on Node.js and PostgreSQL, combining standard DB-Sync tables with custom-optimized indexes for high-speed data access. This dual approach enables advanced search and filtering across both on-chain and off-chain metadata --- including DRep names, stake pool tickers, token labels, and more.\n\nInfrastructure is horizontally scalable. Multiple backend servers work behind load balancer and handle traffic based on real-time utilization. This gives high availability and stable performance, even during peak usage.\n\nThis Treasury Withdrawal is submitted by Intersect on behalf of the vendor. The following sections; Abstract, Motivation, Rationale and Vendor Profile have been sourced from the approved proposal submitted by the Vendor as part of the Intersect budget process.\n\nThis treasury withdrawal funds one of 39 proposals to give effect to the approved budget info action for \u20b3275,269,340, administered by Intersect via gov_action1u9x73kwufaxa70lfy59g4ynwyrcsaxdcd0gxzzmh67s9fxq4j8hqqk2phgh. The information provided herein is intended to fulfill the spirit of the constitutional requirement for a treasury withdrawal info action by also providing the details of the proposed solution, alignment to the budget, and amount to be withdrawn from the Cardano Treasury.",
          "rationale": "### Project Solution\n\n1. For SPOs: Real-time access to block production and stake pool performance, without delays from epoch boundaries or outdated data.\n\n2. For DReps and CC members: Tools for tracking governance activities and accessing voting-related data in clear and transparent way.\n\n3. For developers: Access to fully free REST API that provides Cardano data in easy-to-use JSON format --- helpful for building tools, dashboards, or integrating blockchain data into other applications.\n\n4. For general users: The site works smoothly on all devices, and we keep improving it based on user feedback.\n\n5. For the Cardano ecosystem: AdaStat is a lightweight and open tool that helps Cardano stay decentralized and easy to understand - especially for new users. All of this helps Cardano grow: stronger infrastructure, clearer data, and better long-term adoption.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nAdaStat.net has been actively developed and maintained since Shelley Incentivized Testnet in 2019, with consistent uptime, feature updates, and strong organic community usage. The team has years of experience working with Cardano node, DB-Sync, performance tuning, database optimization, and community engagement. This shows that we've been consistently improving the project over the years, and we plan to keep doing so.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledgebase.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",
          "motivation": "This proposal aims to solve the following problem:\n\nIt's still a challenge to provide Cardano blockchain data in a way that's both decentralized and easy to use. Blockchain explorers are key tools in solving this issue, as they provide access to information about blocks, transactions, stake pools, governance activities, and other on-chain operations. However, each explorer is also potential point of centralization --- it can fail, or show incorrect data. Because of this, it is important for ecosystem to have several independent, performant, and open-source explorers.\n\nAdaStat.net supports this goal by providing real-time, mobile-optimized, and feature-rich explorer for Cardano. Maintaining and improving AdaStat directly strengthens the ecosystem infrastructure, increase transparency of data, and offer valuable tool for SPOs, DReps, CC members, developers, and everyday users.",

The information provided herein is intended to fulfill the spirit of the constitutional requirement for a treasury withdrawal info action by also providing the details of the proposed solution, alignment to the budget, and amount to be withdrawn from the Cardano Treasury.",
          "rationale": "### Project Solution\n\nThis proposal enables Intersect to continue providing essential infrastructure, coordination, and governance support for Cardano during a pivotal 12-month period from June 2025 to June 2026.\n\nSpecifically, this proposal will fund Intersect to:\n\nSteward core infrastructure\n\n- Maintain and govern the open-source Cardano node repositories, including the Haskell codebases\n\n- Coordinate and release upgrades proposed by ecosystem contributors, ensuring safe deployment, roadmap alignment, and stakeholder readiness\n\n- Provide stability and continuity across key engineering practices and upgrade cycles\n\nExecute the Administrator role\n\n- Continue fulfilling the responsibilities of the \"Administrator\" role defined in the Constitution.\n\n- Provide contract and oversight support, including proposal vetting, operational execution, smart contract development, and compliance monitoring\n\n- Act as a reliable counterparty for Treasury-funded initiatives, offering arbitration routes while supporting increased transparency and decentralization\n\nSupport participation and coordination\n\n- Deliver stipends to elected committee members --- beginning formal recognition of their time and expertise\n\n- Facilitate an election process to confirm a new Constitutional Committee\n\n- Provide professional operational and coordination support to 8 committees and 30+ working groups\n\n- Provide through our members, onboarding, tools, and resources for DReps, SPOs, and the Constitutional Committee\n\nFacilitate roadmap and budget processes\n\n- Via the Product Committee, facilitating product roadmap development and long-term ecosystem vision\n\n- Rebuilding a budget process for 2026 and coordinating the delivery and on-chain submission of a 2026 budget\n\n- Conceptualize and operationalize a scalable RFP process for committee-aligned budget proposals (example the Open Source Committee proposal)\n\nExpand Ecosystem Capacity\n\n- Support the emergence of new MBOs, associations, and working groups\n\n- Recognize and reinforce the need for multiple Administrators in the future to support a plural and scalable governance model\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nIntersect is a non-profit member-based organization incorporated in Wyoming, USA. The team at Intersect represents a broad mix of experience and domain expertise, spanning open source, governance, infrastructure, fintech, and decentralized systems. Many of our team members are long-standing contributors to Cardano and are deeply embedded in the ecosystem - both professionally and as community participants.\n\nOur leadership:\n\nJack Briggs - Interim Executive Director\n\n- As of April 25, 2025, Jack now leads Intersect as our Interim Executive Director and will be reaffirming Intersect's mission and core purpose --- bringing Intersect back to serve the community as a lean, accountable, and principled enabler of open collaboration, where decisions are transparent, power is distributed, and progress is driven by those who build and contribute.\n\n- Jack brings over a decade of experience leading large teams for global organizations such as Vodafone and Three Mobile, as well as multiple technology startups, including those focused on open source. Outside of technology, he was twice elected Chairman of a large residents' association representing over 150 households, and in 2018, he stood as a candidate in the UK local elections for a national party.\n\n- Passionate about blockchain, Jack started with Bitcoin in 2012, Ethereum in 2017, and Cardano in 2019. From 2021, he was one of the earliest contributors to Cardano's governance design, including collaborating on the first version of CIP-1694.\n\nNick Cook - Interim Director of Operations\n\n- Nick is an experienced, driven and energetic leader with a proven history of working in the Web3, blockchain, fintech and AI space. Nick has played a critical part in establishing community hubs for Intersect, linking the company with the wider Cardano community. His work has been invaluable for engaging members with our broader mission.\n\nThe Board of Directors are now working on an open recruitment strategy with members at the forefront in confirming a permanent Executive Director.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the Constitution. Intersect will administer the contract on behalf of its members and in alignment with governance actions approved by DReps. This includes coordinating project delivery schedules, reporting progress transparently to our members and the community, and escalating any disputes to the Governing Board and membership for resolution in accordance with established procedures.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Governing Board and Executive team at Intersect, with a Legal Contract established between Intersect and the CDH. Intersect will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the SundaeSwap platform. These details will be shared as part of the budget management tooling process.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored and reported by Intersect's Executive team and will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledge base.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",
          "motivation": "This proposal aims to solve the following problem:\n\nAs Cardano enters the age of Voltaire, governance is transitioning from a small number of founding organizations to a decentralized global community. While the introduction of a constitution and on-chain voting forms the structural backbone, these mechanisms alone are not enough to sustain a functional decentralized system. What's needed in parallel is community-aligned coordination - infrastructure that enables participation, promotes continuity, and supports informed decision-making across the network.\n\nIntersect is also responsible for the stewardship of Cardano's core Haskell codebases, including the repositories that power the core Cardano node. This role involves more than maintenance - it includes coordinating new releases, aligning contributors around engineering best practices, and ensuring that upgrades are ready for safe deployment. Intersect acts as a neutral facilitator in this process, helping translate new feature proposals from ecosystem vendors into stable, tested releases that can be confidently adopted across the network.\n\nIntersect has played a central role in coordinating ecosystem-wide upgrades, including the successful deployment of the Chang and Plomin hard forks. These upgrades required aligning infrastructure providers, SPOs, dApps, and exchanges globally - a process demanding deep technical coordination, ecosystem trust, and communications capacity.\n\nBeyond technical infrastructure, Intersect provides a collaborative space for governance to mature and grow, supporting over 30 working groups and eight elected committees made up of Cardano community members. These committees focus on key areas such as budgeting, product development, open source, membership, growth, and technical standards - offering non-binding recommendations and practical insight to on-chain actors like DReps and SPOs.",

          "abstract": "This treasury withdrawal funds **Cardano Summit 2025 and regional tech events** which will provide the following services:\n\nThe Cardano Summit 2025 is a strategic initiative, spearheaded by the Cardano Foundation and fortified by regional ecosystem partners (EMURGO, Rare Evo, Wada, Catalyst Africa Town Hall, Ada Solar), to accelerate the global adoption of Cardano technology. Each partner will command the execution of a regionally focused Cardano Summit Event. While each maintains regional autonomy, all six entities will synergize in the events' development. The core ethos and driving benefits of the Cardano Summit are:\n\n- Simplify developer onboarding through targeted Cardano Dev Days events globally.\n\n- Drive adoption through targeted education for first-time and novice users, unlocking Cardano's potential for all.\n\n- Showcase tangible impact of real-world use cases, capturing mainstream attention and demonstrating Cardano's value.\n\n- Forge powerful collaborations between developers, entrepreneurs, users, enterprises and regulators.\n\n- Strategize and solve scaling and interoperability challenges, securing future scalability.\n\n- Attract capital, talent, and media, securing vital resources for the growth of Cardano as a leading L1.\n\n- Ignite innovation & celebrate success: Rally the community, celebrate achievements, and build unstoppable momentum.\n\nThis Treasury Withdrawal is submitted by Intersect on behalf of the vendor. The following sections; Abstract, Motivation, Rationale and Vendor Profile have been sourced from the approved proposal submitted by the Vendor as part of the Intersect budget process.\n\nThis treasury withdrawal funds one of 39 proposals to give effect to the approved budget info action for \u20b3275,269,340, administered by Intersect via gov_action1u9x73kwufaxa70lfy59g4ynwyrcsaxdcd0gxzzmh67s9fxq4j8hqqk2phgh. The information provided herein is intended to fulfill the spirit of the constitutional requirement for a treasury withdrawal info action by also providing the details of the proposed solution, alignment to the budget, and amount to be withdrawn from the Cardano Treasury.",
          "rationale": "### Project Solution\n\nThe Cardano Summit proposal aims to provide:\n\n1 x Flagship Cardano Summit: Europe (November 2025)\n\n4 x Regional Cardano Tech Events\nLas Vegas, USA (August 2025)\nAfrica (September 2025)\nLATAM (October 2025)\nBangalore, India (December 2025)\n\nCardano Summit Awards & Battle of the Builders\nIncluded within the Flagship Cardano Summit\n\nDev Days/Hackathons\nIntegrated into each of the four Regional Tech Events\n\nSpecific KPIs\nAttendee targets (500-800 attendees per event)\nSpeaker targets (20-100 speakers per event)\nSession targets (8-20 sessions per event).\n\nSupporting information: [https://ucarecdn.com/f4055c0d-2123-49f1-8d6b-7db3ed1187a5/CardanoSummit2025IntersectProposal.pdf](https://ucarecdn.com/f4055c0d-2123-49f1-8d6b-7db3ed1187a5/CardanoSummit2025IntersectProposal.pdf)\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nThe Cardano Summit 2025 will leverage the collective strength and deep regional expertise of its co-hosts, ensuring unparalleled impact and engagement across the globe.\n\nThe Cardano Foundation's proven delivery of three consecutive, globally impactful Cardano Summits establishes their invaluable institutional and enterprise knowledge and a track record of high-quality, large-scale event execution.\n\nEMURGO's extensive experience in fostering blockchain adoption through strategic events, including TOKEN2049, positions them as a key driver of regional engagement and impact.\n\nRare Evo demonstrated expertise in curating highly engaging and community-centric blockchain events, like Rare Evo, ensures a dynamic and impactful experience for attendees.\n\nWADA's established presence and deep connections within the Cardano community in Africa, coupled with their successful track record of organizing CLEs, guarantees strong local engagement and relevance.\n\nADA Solar's unique understanding of the regional landscape and their proven ability to activate local communities, exemplified by Cardano Constitutional Convention and Cardano Tech Week, will be instrumental in maximizing the summit's reach and impact in LATAM.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledgebase.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",
          "motivation": "This proposal aims to solve the following problem:\n\nThe Cardano Summit is not optional; it's the indispensable catalyst to empower developers, unify infrastructure efforts and implement governance, forge global connections, plus attract capital, talent and media, propelling Cardano to its rightful place as a leader in the decentralized future.\n\nAdoption Stagnation: Without a central platform showcasing real-world utility, enterprise and mainstream adoption remains critically low.\n\nDeveloper Isolation and Fake News: The narrative that \"building on Cardano is hard\" persists due to inadequate educational resources and targeted support, hindering developer onboarding, slowing application and infrastructure growth.\n\nInfrastructure Fragmentation: Scaling and interoperability challenges persist without a collaborative platform for unified solutions. Collaboration between developers, entrepreneurs, users, enterprises, regulatory bodies and other L1/L2 ecosystems need further strengthening to foster a cohesive and impactful ecosystem.\n\nCommunity Siloing: Missed networking and knowledge exchange opportunities between developers, entrepreneurs, users, enterprises, and regulatory bodies limit the creation of strategic global partnerships.\n\nCapital, Talent, and Media Acquisition Deficit: The challenge of effectively attracting and securing sufficient capital, top-tier talent, and widespread media attention hinders Cardano's growth and its ability to solidify its position as a leading Layer 1 blockchain platform.",

          "abstract": "This treasury withdrawal funds **Expanding Stablecoin / Cardano Native Asset Support / Fiat Ramps** which will provide the following services:\n\n1. Expanding wallet and custodian support for Cardano native assets (including USDA, a Cardano-native stablecoin).\n\n2. Increasing the availability of Cardano stablecoins and native assets on exchanges and OTC desks.\n\n3. Driving real-world utility for USDA in cross-border payments, remittances, and enterprise settlements.\n\n4. Building cost-effective fiat on/off-ramps for ADA and Cardano native assets in frontier markets.\n\nBy addressing these challenges, Anzens aims to boost liquidity, accessibility, and adoption of Cardano's DeFi and real-world use cases, bridging traditional finance with our open source blockchain-based payments.\n\nThis Treasury Withdrawal is submitted by Intersect on behalf of the vendor. The following sections; Abstract, Motivation, Rationale and Vendor Profile have been sourced from the approved proposal submitted by the Vendor as part of the Intersect budget process.\n\nThis treasury withdrawal funds one of 39 proposals to give effect to the approved budget info action for \u20b3275,269,340, administered by Intersect via gov_action1u9x73kwufaxa70lfy59g4ynwyrcsaxdcd0gxzzmh67s9fxq4j8hqqk2phgh. The information provided herein is intended to fulfill the spirit of the constitutional requirement for a treasury withdrawal info action by also providing the details of the proposed solution, alignment to the budget, and amount to be withdrawn from the Cardano Treasury.",
          "rationale": "### Project Solution\n\na. Wallet Support for Cardano Native Assets: USDA is pursuing strategic partnerships with firms like Zoida Markets, and in talks with BitGo, Zodia Custody, CipherBC, etc. Our goal is to enhance Cardano Native Assets by improving reach, reliability, and pricing through collaboration with key custodians, and wallet infrastructure providers---ultimately boosting distribution, liquidity and user adoption.\n\nb. Availability of USDA / Native Assets on Exchanges, OTC Desks and NEO Banks: Anzens is focused on bringing USDA to CEXs, NEO banks, OTC desks, and other key distributors to expand its reach. By enabling USDA pairs for Cardano tokens on exchanges, we aim to boost usability, drive adoption through spot listings, and support broader participation via derivatives trading. Enabling USDA with NEO banks would offer USDA <> Fiat pairs in exotic currencies\n\nc. Drive USDA adoption to unlock real-world utility: Anzens would be initiating cross integration with real estate developers, remittance companies and other payment companies to bring USDA as part of their backend settlement network, helping Cardano gain adoption beyond the crypto space.\n\nd. Access to Fiat on and off-ramps: Encryptus has piloted ADA-to-fiat off-ramps for Yoroi Wallet users, enabling users to convert ADA to local currencies across 70+ countries---including India, China, Philippines, Nigeria etc---via bank transfers, without relying on SWIFT or card networks. Encryptus aims to build stronger on-ramps with local payment rails.\n\nThe funds from this proposal would be utilized to:\n\n1. Develop Onramp Capabilities: Current ADA onramps via cards are costly and don't support Cardano Native Assets. Encryptus aims to solve this by offering low-cost onramps through local bank transfers and mobile wallets---cutting costs by up to 60%. This will ease access to ADA and native assets. Ideal for Cardano DeFi and wider eco-system. Phase 1 of the services would include countries in LATAM, Africa and parts of Asia with a Phase 2 expansion to developed economies.\n\n2. Cardano's deterministic fee structure makes it well-suited for payment use cases. However, integration with traditional payment systems has been a challenge. Encryptus is addressing this by developing alternative payment solutions---such as global bill payments, school fees, and Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) products---on the Cardano blockchain. These initiatives showcase Cardano's practical value to Web2 users, helping to broaden its adoption and real-world relevance.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nOur team brings together seasoned professionals with deep expertise in payments, stablecoins, and cryptocurrency infrastructure, backed by 50 years of combined experience at leading firms such as Paxos, Huobi (HTX), OKX, Western Union, Citi Bank, and BitPesa (AZA Finance). We have played pivotal roles in advancing fintech innovation, blockchain payments, and digital asset ecosystems, equipping us with unmatched insights into global payment networks, compliance, and scalable financial solutions.\n\nMultidisciplinary Leadership\n\nOur team includes former CEOs, legal counsels, product leads, and senior strategists with expertise across technology, compliance, and business development.\n\nKey strengths include:\n\n- Crypto & Stablecoins: Hands-on experience in liquidity management, institutional adoption, and blockchain-based payments.\n\n- Building global remittance networks that facilitate seamless cross-border transactions in the frontier and emerging markets\n\n- Technology & Product: Proven track record in building secure, compliant financial infrastructure for payments and digital assets.\n\n- Scaling crypto exchanges and developing liquidity solutions to support institutional and retail trading.\n\n- Regulatory & Compliance: Direct experience navigating global financial regulations for stablecoins and cross-border transactions.\n\n- Business Growth: Successfully expanded operations and partnerships across North America, Europe, Africa, and Southeast Asia.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledgebase.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",
          "motivation": "1. Lack of Wallet & Custodian Support for Cardano Native Assets:\n\nMajor institutional custodians (e.g BitGo, Fireblocks) do not natively support Cardano native assets, including USDA. This creates a bottleneck for exchanges, OTC desks and institutions who rely on these custodians for secure asset storage. Without custodian integration:\n\n-Exchanges cannot list Cardano-native assets, limiting liquidity and trading opportunities\n\n-Institutional investors face custody risks, reducing their willingness to engage with Cardano Ecosystem\n\n-Cardano projects struggle to attract capital, as investors prefer assets with established custody solutions\n\nImpact:The absence of institutional-grade custody solutions stifles liquidity, restricts market access and slows Cardano's growth.\n\n2. Limited Availability of Cardano Native Assets on Exchanges & OTC Desks:\n\nDespite Cardano's $700M+ DeFi ecosystem, its native assets---including stablecoins---are severely underrepresented on centralized exchanges (CEXs) and OTC desks.\n\n-Few trading pairs for Cardano assets (eg. ADA/USDA, USDA/USDT)\n\n-No derivatives markets (futures, options) for Cardano stablecoins, limiting trading volumes\n\n-OTC desks avoid Cardano-native assets due to limited institutional LPs\n\nImpact: Without deep exchange liquidity, traders and institutions cannot efficiently enter or exit positions\n\n3. Lack of Real-World Stablecoin Utility Beyond Crypto Trading:\n\nStablecoins mainly serve crypto trading, with USDC gaining enterprise use---while Cardano's stablecoins remain underutilized across real-world sectors:\n\n-Cross-border B2B payments ($31.6 trillion market)\n\n-Remittances ($850 billion market and where low fees matter)\n\n-Payroll & merchant settlements\n\nCardano's low fee structure makes it ideal for payments, but the lack of integration with traditional finance, prevents adoption.\n\nImpact: Without real-world use cases, Cardano's stablecoins are limited to DeFi\n\n4. Restricted Fiat On/Off-Ramp, Especially in Frontier Markets:\n\nUsers in emerging markets (Africa, LATAM, Asia) struggle to convert ADA and Cardano-native assets into local fiat due to:\n\n-High fees (5-7% for card-based ramps vs. ~1% for local bank transfers\n\n-Limited payout network & banking access\n\nImpact: Limited DeFi participation and slow retail adoption due to costly on/off ramps.\n\nEthereum & Ripple are expanding stablecoin adoption. Without custody solutions, Cardano misses institutional demand. Stablecoins will reshape global finance, and frontier markets need blockchain.",

          "abstract": "This treasury withdrawal funds **Input Output Research (IOR): Cardano Vision - Work Program 2025** which will provide the following services:\n\nThe IOR proposal for Work Program 2025 consists of 20 research streams and 6 technology validation streams from Cardano Vision, a five-year program consisting of 34 research streams across 9 thematic focus areas. Over a five-year period, this funnel approach is expected to generate over 100 high-quality research outputs and provide the foundation for 30 or more technology validation streams, to be implemented into Cardano's Testnet and Mainnet by engineers and developers from the Cardano community.\n\nThis Treasury Withdrawal is submitted by Intersect on behalf of the vendor. The following sections; Abstract, Motivation, Rationale and Vendor Profile have been sourced from the approved proposal submitted by the Vendor as part of the Intersect budget process.\n\nThis treasury withdrawal funds one of 39 proposals to give effect to the approved budget info action for \u20b3275,269,340, administered by Intersect via gov_action1u9x73kwufaxa70lfy59g4ynwyrcsaxdcd0gxzzmh67s9fxq4j8hqqk2phgh. The information provided herein is intended to fulfill the spirit of the constitutional requirement for a treasury withdrawal info action by also providing the details of the proposed solution, alignment to the budget, and amount to be withdrawn from the Cardano Treasury.\n\nNote: This withdrawal request has been reduced on request by the Vendor from the Budget Info Action approved \u20b326,848,000 to \u20b326,840,000.",
          "rationale": "### Project Solution\n\nSince 2017, IOR has published over 200 research papers, demonstrating its commitment to advancing blockchain science for the benefit of Cardano.\n\nEach year, IOR aims to generate a pipeline of at least 20 high-impact research initiatives for the Cardano ecosystem at SRL2*, supported by peer-reviewed research papers and technical reports. From this funnel, 6 of these initiatives will be validated and prioritized for implementation at SRL4/5*, reinforcing Cardano's leadership in blockchain R&D.\n\n* **Fundamental Research**\n\nResearch outputs vary in complexity and significance, with the average paper taking at least two years to complete due to the rigorous academic peer-review process.\n\nAs research conferences grow increasingly competitive, underscoring the need for excellence and relevance, we remain committed to delivering at least 20 high-quality publications and technical artefacts each year.\n\nTo maximize visibility and impact, we are strengthening dissemination efforts across academic and Cardano-specific channels to boost citations, engagement, and impact.\n\n* **Technology Validation**\n\nTechnology Validation will validate 6 research initiatives annually, including technical reports, formal specifications, prototypes, simulations, Cardano Problem Statements (CPSs), and Cardano Improvement Proposals (CIPs). Prototypes and technical documentation. Please note, workstreams starting in the second half of the year will be delivered the following year.\n\nTechnical reports provide in-depth analysis and implementation guidance, while prototypes demonstrate real-world application for product teams within the Cardano ecosystem.\n\nCPSs and CIPs play a key role in driving transparency, collaboration, and community-driven enhancements.\n\nSoftware Readiness Levels (SRLs) outline the lifecycle of a technology, from basic principles to commercial readiness, using an internationally accepted scale of 1-9.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nIOR is the leading blockchain academic group in the worldwide research community. Currently, the Input Output Research library contains over 200 peer-reviewed, published papers, involving more than 150 academics.\n\nAround 50 of these papers are core to Cardano's five development phases, providing the foundational research and innovation that has helped shape Cardano into its current form. Input Output Global has also contributed to more than 40 CIPs and 6 CPSs.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledgebase.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",
          "motivation": "This proposal aims to solve the following problem:\n\nThe Input Output Research (IOR) proposal aims to support research initiatives that deliver value over 3-5 years for the continued growth of the Cardano ecosystem. Building on Cardano's robust foundation---including a proven record of 100% uptime---the proposal is guided by a Strategic Research Agenda rooted in an Evidence-Based Methodology. With a focus on scalability, sustainability, and interoperability, this approach ensures a rigorous, market readiness methodology. It covers conceptual design through to implementation, resulting in a consistent pipeline of high-quality, validated innovations that provide enduring benefit to the Cardano platform.\n\nCardano Vision is an ambitious five-year research initiative spanning nine thematic focus areas, organized into structured annual work programs. Its purpose is to solidify Cardano's position as a leader in blockchain innovation. Achieving this vision requires breakthroughs in critical technologies, including next-generation consensus protocols like Ouroboros Omega, zero-knowledge proofs, quantum-resistant cryptography, and advanced smart contract capabilities. These advancements will equip Cardano to address global challenges while upholding the highest standards of security, efficiency, and innovation.\n\nThis strategic approach delivers broad impact---strengthening Cardano's global research leadership and producing tangible outputs such as academic papers, technical recommendations, and validated prototypes. Commercializing deep technologies like Web3 cannot rely solely on market demand; it depends on sustained scientific and technical excellence. Without proactive investment, valuable opportunities may be lost. Critical infrastructure must also undergo rigorous research and validation, as flaws can compromise network security or endanger user assets. By focusing on high-potential R&D areas, this initiative builds a strong foundation for innovation, accelerates time to market, and drives meaningful economic and societal outcomes.",

On top of this we provide the security guarantees that are the reason for the Cardano community to embrace functional programming - thus offering an accessible and easy to start with alternative to current languages.\n\nOpShin is aimed at developers that want to build on Cardano. It drastically simplifies onboarding when experience in Python is given, and even without is easy to read and access.\n\nBy making development of Smart Contracts more accessible, OpShin is a key catalyst for a growing ecosystem of DApps on Cardano. The benefit to the community is immense.\n\nThe project is under ongoing development. The language itself is already completed and production ready, but the Smart Contract Ecosystem is always evolving (i.e. new Plutus versions, standards, CIPs). This evolution requires continuous adaptations. The proposal is enough to fund further development for one year. There are no fixed deliverables as it is hard to predict the changes in the ecosystem.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nThe main proposer, Niels, has already bootstrapped the main part of the project. In its current form the tool is able to be used and already being used. The proposer is completely doxed and well-known in the Community.\n\nHe also has a strong network of competent and experienced developers interested and capable in supporting the project.\n\nHe is supported on a per-demand basis by contributors to OpShin such as Julius Frost and S.C. Musson, who have redeemed themselves by contributing valuable improvements.\n\nThe main goal of this proposal is to improve usability and developer experience with respect to Smart Contracts on Cardano. With the given funds, the continued development of the toolchain is secured as developers can be hired to tackle basic issues in the toolchain whereas the main proposer is able to allocate more time of the day towards developing OpShin himself.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledgebase.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",
          "motivation": "This proposal aims to solve the following problem:\n\nDeveloping Smart Contracts on Cardano is difficult to get started with. Historically, the functional programming paradigm of Haskell and Plutus has scared away new developers. Aiken, Plu-ts and similar alternatives are also based on functional programming. Moreover all of these languages are rare, some specifically designed for Cardano Contracts. Thus, if developers want to start building for Cardano, they need to learn a completely new language.",

          "rationale": "### Project Solution\n\nPyCardano is a Python library designed to facilitate interaction with the Cardano blockchain by enabling users to create and sign transactions without relying on third-party serialization tools. This independence makes PyCardano lightweight and easy to set up across various environments. \u200b\n\nDeveloping PyCardano addresses the challenges mentioned above by providing a native Python library tailored for the Cardano blockchain. This initiative aims to lower the entry barrier for Python developers, fostering a more inclusive and diverse developer community. By eliminating the need for third-party serialization tools, PyCardano simplifies the development workflow, enhancing both efficiency and reliability. This project not only broadens the accessibility of Cardano to a wider range of developers but also encourages innovation and the creation of new applications within the ecosystem.\u200b\n\nBy implementing this proposal, we anticipate the following outcomes:\n\nSustained Compatibility: PyCardano will remain compatible with the latest Cardano protocol versions, enabling developers to build and maintain applications without disruption.\u200b Although there isn't a clearly specified roadmap or hardfork for Cardano in the next 12 months, we know it is likely that there will be Leios and Midnight integration. These integration and changes will more or less require corresponding updates in PyCardano.\n\n[https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/ouroboros-leios-design-goals-and-concepts/](https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/ouroboros-leios-design-goals-and-concepts/)\n\n[https://midnight.network/](https://midnight.network/)\n\nImproved Stability: Ongoing maintenance and prompt bug fixes will enhance the library's stability and reliability.\u200b\n\nEnhanced Developer Experience: Up-to-date documentation and community support will provide a more accessible and user-friendly experience for developers.\u200b\n\nCommunity Growth: Active engagement with the developer community will foster collaboration, innovation, and the broader adoption of PyCardano.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nJerry, the creator of PyCardano, will lead this project. His deep understanding of both the library and Cardano's ecosystem makes him uniquely qualified to oversee this upgrade.\n\nJerry's experience as a blockchain developer ensures that the technical challenges of aligning with the Chang hardfork can be effectively addressed.\n\nTrack Record:\n\nThe success of PyCardano, with over 170 dependent projects on GitHub and 7,000+ monthly downloads, demonstrates our team's ability to create and maintain critical infrastructure for the Cardano ecosystem.\n\nThe active Discord community (100+ members) shows our ongoing engagement with users and our ability to address their needs.\n\nTechnical Expertise:\n\nOur team's familiarity with Cardano's protocol, combined with expertise in Python development, positions us to efficiently implement the necessary upgrades.\n\nWe have a history of successfully adapting PyCardano to previous Cardano updates, showcasing our ability to respond to network changes.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledgebase.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",
          "motivation": "This proposal aims to solve the following problem:\n\nThe Cardano ecosystem primarily offers development tools and libraries in Haskell and JavaScript, creating a significant barrier for Python developers who wish to engage with the platform. This limitation hinders the growth and diversification of the developer community within the Cardano ecosystem. Furthermore, existing tools often depend on external serialization libraries, complicating the development process and potentially introducing additional points of failure. The absence of a native Python library that seamlessly integrates with Cardano's infrastructure restricts the ability of developers to build and deploy applications efficiently.",

The goal is to allow smart contracts on Cardano to verify cryptographic proofs over customizable curves and fields. This will include:\n\n- Plutarch support for Galois field arithmetic\n\n- Plutarch support for elliptic curve arithmetic\n\n- A generic ZK verifier in Plutarch\n\n- A validation test suite over BLS12-381\n\n- A composable YTxP-compatible Plutarch wrapper\n\nThis tool empowers developers with on-chain cryptographic flexibility, expands Cardano's ZK application capabilities, and sets the stage for future innovations in privacy and authentication.\n\nDeliver a parameterized elliptic curve and finite field cryptography framework in Plutarch, enabling developers to build smart contracts that verify zero-knowledge proofs over arbitrary curves. This flexibility empowers privacy-focused dApps, improves composability, and advances Cardano's technical capabilities. It creates a foundation for a wide range of ZK-powered features while reducing duplication of effort across the ecosystem.\n\nThis Treasury Withdrawal is submitted by Intersect on behalf of the vendor. The following sections; Abstract, Motivation, Rationale and Vendor Profile have been sourced from the approved proposal submitted by the Vendor as part of the Intersect budget process.\n\nThis treasury withdrawal funds one of 39 proposals to give effect to the approved budget info action for \u20b3275,269,340, administered by Intersect via gov_action1u9x73kwufaxa70lfy59g4ynwyrcsaxdcd0gxzzmh67s9fxq4j8hqqk2phgh. The information provided herein is intended to fulfill the spirit of the constitutional requirement for a treasury withdrawal info action by also providing the details of the proposed solution, alignment to the budget, and amount to be withdrawn from the Cardano Treasury.",
          "rationale": "### Project Solution\n\nMLabs will create a two-part proof-of-concept system, named Grumpelstilskin, designed to allow application developers to easily use any curve of their choice for zero-knowledge proof verification on-chain. The first part of Grumpelstilskin will be a 'working script' which, when given appropriate parameters via its datum, will verify a zero-knowledge proof over a user-specified curve. This script will be tested for correctness.\n\nThe second part of Grumpelstiltskin will be a YTxP-based interface to the 'working script', implemented in Plutarch. This interface will be well-documented, easy to use, and flexible, with a focus of making life easy for application developers who want to use zero-knowledge proofs. Thanks to their use of YTxP, future performance, security and functionality improvements will not be the responsibility of application developers who use Grumpelstilskin. This second part will be distributed as an open-source project.\n\nMLabs aims to build a minimum viable product, with the future goals of expanded functionality, improved performance, as well as a full audit of the 'working script'. The choice of YTxP will make it minimally difficult to achieve this,and will impose minimal friction on any application developers using Grumpelstiltskin to build their products.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nMLabs has extensive experience in cryptography, Plutarch smart contracts, and zero-knowledge systems. Our past work includes Plutarch, the Cardano Transaction Library, and zkApp R&D. We are contributors to multiple community standards and tooling projects (e.g., CTL, Ply, Cardano.nix).\n\nAlso we have done work towards bitwise operators previously in CIP-123 which is related to this work and can possibly be used towards its implementation.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledgebase.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",
          "motivation": "This proposal aims to solve the following problem:\n\nCardano currently lacks reusable and composable on-chain cryptographic tooling for elliptic curves and finite fields. Developers building ZK or privacy-preserving applications must either hardcode specific cryptographic primitives (limiting generality) or implement complex curve logic themselves (introducing security risks and inefficiencies). There is no widely accepted, verifiable standard for parameterized zero-knowledge verification on Cardano.",

          "abstract": "This treasury withdrawal funds **MLabs Core Tool Maintenance & Enhancement: Cardano.nix** which will provide the following services:\n\nThis proposal seeks annual funding for the maintenance and enhancement of Cardano.nix, a foundational toolset for building and deploying Cardano infrastructure with Nix. Funding covers regular maintenance to ensure compatibility with Cardano node updates and the Nix ecosystem, bug fixes, and minor enhancements to improve the tooling based on community needs and developments in related areas like Nix Flakes*.*\n\nThis Treasury Withdrawal is submitted by Intersect on behalf of the vendor. The following sections; Abstract, Motivation, Rationale and Vendor Profile have been sourced from the approved proposal submitted by the Vendor as part of the Intersect budget process.\n\nThis treasury withdrawal funds one of 39 proposals to give effect to the approved budget info action for \u20b3275,269,340, administered by Intersect via gov_action1u9x73kwufaxa70lfy59g4ynwyrcsaxdcd0gxzzmh67s9fxq4j8hqqk2phgh. The information provided herein is intended to fulfill the spirit of the constitutional requirement for a treasury withdrawal info action by also providing the details of the proposed solution, alignment to the budget, and amount to be withdrawn from the Cardano Treasury.",
          "rationale": "### Project Solution\n\nFunding this proposal ensures the Cardano community continues to have access to a maintained and reliable Cardano.nix toolset. This benefits anyone deploying Cardano infrastructure (nodes, wallets, explorers) using Nix, including SPOs, developers, and enterprises. The value lies in providing reproducible, robust deployment methods, reducing configuration errors and setup time. The ROI is improved infrastructure reliability, easier onboarding for Nix users into Cardano, and support for key ecosystem players like IOG and the Daedalus Wallet team.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nMLabs LTD is the primary developer and maintainer of Cardano.nix. Our team possesses deep expertise in Nix, Cardano infrastructure deployment, and maintaining complex build systems, evidenced by the successful delivery and maintenance of Cardano.nix and its use by key ecosystem entities.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledgebase.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",
          "motivation": "This proposal aims to solve the following problem:\n\nCardano.nix provides foundational toolsets for building and deploying Cardano infrastructure reproducibly using Nix. Maintaining reliable infrastructure tooling is essential for node operators, developers, and projects running Cardano components. This tooling requires regular maintenance to track updates in Nixpkgs, Cardano node versions, and related Haskell ecosystem components, as well as potential enhancements to improve usability or incorporate features from related toolsets (like flake-lang.nix). This proposal seeks funding for this necessary upkeep.",

          "title": "Cardano GovTool Budget - 12 months full active maintenance and development",
          "abstract": "Following 4 weeks of active community consultation, the newly formed Cardano Govtool Consortium, made of all the community builders who actively develop the applications that make Govtool (ByronNetwork, WeDeliver, LidoNation and DQquadrant), those who use its code and APIs and individual contributors, proposes this Info Action to continue active maintenance and development of every application that makes GovTool itself, as the open-source community-owned set of tools built for public good, functioning as Cardano\u2019s core interface for low-barrier participation in on-chain governance. As current funding concludes in June 2025, the new proposal outlines a leaner, more inclusive funding structure built to reflect community priorities.\nOver the past four weeks, substantial feedback was collected, through open forums, working groups, and direct contributions, by the community members participating in the Consortium. This feedback was carefully analyzed and embedded into a tiered proposal that balances operational stability, cost efficiency, and ecosystem-wide participation. The overall direction suggested by the community, considering the clear streamlined costs and the many options to contribute in its development, is to continue for the next 12 months to actively develop and evolve these tools, expanding further its open-source structure.\nWith  this Info Action, the Cardano Govtool Consortium aims to transparently share a revised direction and gauge broad community support. If positively received, it will enable the submission of a follow-up Treasury Withdrawal governance action to fund GovTool active development for the next 12 months.\n",
          "rationale": "Cardano Govtool builders have been working on these tools since before CIP-1694 was approved, overcoming the complex and new challenges of making it easy for everyone to participate in the new governance of Cardano. From helping shape on-chain governance with SanchoNet Govtool, to supporting the bootstrapping phase of governance and enabling the Chang Hard-Fork with Voltaire Govtool and finally opening access and participation to full governance by supporting the first community lead upgrade, Plomin. During this time Govtool has been used by hundreds of thousands of users, always open-sourced and built with direct contribution from the broader Cardano community. Govtool is designed to be a true open source community-owned solution, so in the past 8 weeks, and even more in the past 4 weeks, the newly formed Cardano Govtool Consortium have opened many more paths for discussion and feedback, making the inner processes more visible and easily accessible, providing more paths for participation, and collecting an incredible amount of direct insights and input on how to improve Govtool, how to further open its development and how to keep it funded for the public good.\n\nA tier approach was proposed, discussed and refined to provide clarity and transparency on costs and options. The discussions and feedback collected indicated a strong will to continue with full active development and maintenance and expanded options for individual contributors as well as support of other open-source governance tools using Cardano\u2019s Govtool APIs or code. This aligns with the level 3 funding outlined below (and detailed in the [full length proposal](https://docs.gov.tools/important-updates/govtool-maintenance-ending-soon/updated-budget-proposal/updated-govtool-budget-proposal-long-version))\n\n### Tiered costs:\n\n**Budget request by the Cardano Govtool Consortium**: \u20b31.15M ($920k) to cover 12 months of Active development and maintenance.\n\n* **Level 1 \u2013 Foundational maintenance ($330K / \u20b3412.5K)**  \n  * Covers minimum operational costs:  \n    * Infrastructure maintenance, hosting, CI/CD, and security. (0.25 FTE + hosting costs)  \n    * Core maintenance team (1 FTE QA and 1 FTE full-stack developer, split across 4 contributors to avoid downtime).  \n    * Ensures GovTool stays online, secure, and functional, but without any new features.  \n* **Level 2 \u2013 Incentivised Participation ($530K / \u20b3662.5K)**  \n  * All in Level 1   \n  * \u20b3150,000 to be allocated organically via direct contribution on the repos  \n  * \u20b3100,000 to be allocated to other open source governance tools that provide new and better ways to participate in Cardano Governance leveraging (and where possible expanding) Govtool code or Govtool APIs  \n* **Level 3 \u2013 Active Development & Maintenance for each pillar ($920k - \u20b31.15M)**  \n  * All in level 1 (minus the $240k cost of repo maintainers which is absorbed)  \n  * All in Level 2  \n  * Accelerated growth and guaranteed monthly updates:  \n    * Funds full-time development per functional pillar:  \n      * Proposals Pillar (1 FTE)  \n      * Delegation Pillar (1.5 FTE)  \n      * Voting Pillar (1.5 FTE)  \n      * Outcomes Pillar (0.75 FTE)  \n      * Budget Discussions Pillar (0.5 FTE)  \n    * Adds dedicated end-to-end testing (1 FTE) to ensure reliability.\n\n#### Any unused funds will be returned to the Cardano Treasury. Cardano Govtool project will continue to be steered through the Governance Tools Working Group, maintaining open contribution pathways for new teams and community members.\n\n### How will this budget be administered / managed\n\n* If approved, this budget will be administered by Intersect using the smart contract framework proposed  \n* In details the budget will be distributed in:  \n  * 4 smart contracts divided in monthly milestones for each of the builders submitting this proposal  \n  * 1 smart contract for devOps (to be allocated via an open and transparent grant process)  \n  * 2 smart contracts of \u20b3100k and \u20b3150k to be handled in the andamio platform and distributed respectively to individual contributors and to other open source governance tools that provide new and better ways to participate in Cardano Governance leveraging (and where possible expanding) Govtool code or Govtool APIs  \n* The builders submitting this proposal are:   \n  * LidoNation > they will support the outcomes pillar  \n  * ByronNetwork > they will support the delegation and voting pillars  \n  * WeDeliver > they will support the Proposal discussion and Budget proposals pillars  \n  * DQuadrant > they will support the full end-to-end testing  \n* The builders get direction from the Cardano Community which owns these tools via Governance Tools Working group. This effort is also currently supported by Intersect staff, not funded via this proposal, which helps facilitate and coordinate processes  \n* Others who use Govtool APIs which will benefit from this proposal being funded and who will also access the incentives of level 2 are the builders of cardanobudget.com, 1694.io, tempo.vote, Governancespace.com, budget.cardano.africa, 1694.tools and more\n\n### Constitutionality checklist\nFollowing the format of previously submitted budget info actions, here is a checklist of points which we believe cover the constitutionality of this proposal.\n\n#### Purpose\n\u2705 This proposal is for work intended to ensure Cardano Governance remains easy to access and participate to, keeping governance decentralized, including all the off-chain processes needed to make governance work ensuring the long-term sustainability of Cardano. This is directly supporting ARTICLE III. PARTICIPATORY AND DECENTRALIZED GOVERNANCE\n\n#### Article III.5: the process of on-chain governance\n\u2705 We have submitted this proposal in a standardized, legible format, which includes a URL and hash of all documented off-chain content. We believe our rationale to be detailed and sufficient. The proposal contains a title, abstract, reason for the proposal and relevant supporting materials.\n\n#### Article IV.1: proposing budgets\n\u2705 This proposal accords with the provisions of this article as it is intended to cover \"the ongoing operation \u2026 of the Cardano Blockchain ecosystem and for covering other costs related to the implementation, administration and maintenance of the decentralized, on-chain governance processes provided for in this Constitution.\"\n\u2705 This proposal covers a period of 73 epochs, which is permitted in this section of the Constitution, to match the Net-Change Limit period.\n\n#### Article IV.2: funds administration\n\u2705 This proposal specifies an administrator in accordance with this provision. The details of the administration process are aligned with the structure provided by Intersect as administrator\n\n#### Article IV.3: Net-Change Limit\n\u2705 Being of \u20b31.15M, this proposal and the treasury withdrawals it would enable do not violate the currently agreed upon Net-Change Limit.\n\n#### Article IV.4: Auditor\n\u2705 This proposal, if approved, intends to use part of the \u20b3100k committed by Intersect to cover cost of periodic independent audits\n\n#### Guardrails\n\u2705 This proposal is subject to TREASURY-04a in that it defines a Cardano blockchain ecosystem budget. It requires a threshold greater than 50% of the DReps' active voting stake to be considered approved and enable subsequent withdrawals pertaining to this budget.\n\n### Value provided so far\nGovTool is now a widely used and trusted governance tool, with:\n\n* 48,000+ unique mainnet users across 170+ countries  \n* 30,000+ beta testers  \n* 1,000+ governance transactions initiated via the platform  \n* Full integration with other ecosystem tools: cardanobudget.com, 1694.io, tempo.vote, Governancespace.com, budget.cardano.africa, 1694.tools and more  \n* A robust API used by independent projects\n\nThe Governance Tools Working Group has held 65+ open meetings, elevating collaboration between contributors, users, and researchers. With this foundation, Cardano\u2019s community is now capable of driving much of the ongoing roadmap, having a team of decentralized community builders, and Intersect as a facilitator and supporter.\n\n### Why you should support this proposal\nBeyond enabling core governance, open and decentralised participation, GovTool contributes to the broader strength and modularity of the Cardano ecosystem. Supporting this proposal means investing in infrastructure that delivers added value across multiple dimensions:\n\n* **Open-Source Building Blocks**  \n  GovTool\u2019s codebase is modular, well-documented, making it reusable for a wide range of governance projects  \n* **Strengthening the DApp Ecosystem**  \n  By offering battle-tested components (transaction builders, wallet UX flows, metadata validation, governance action schemas), GovTool acts as a toolbox for other developers building compliant, secure DApps.  \n* **Transparent & Reusable Infrastructure**  \n  GovTool offers openly accessible APIs, reusable E2E tests, and public analytics dashboards, enabling other projects to build with confidence, validate governance flows, and reuse proven infrastructure without reinventing the wheel.  \n* **Ecosystem Interoperability**  \n  Projects like 1694.io, Cardano Budget Analytics, and multiple delegation portals already consume GovTool APIs and frontend logic, demonstrating its value beyond its primary interface.  \n* **Best Practices in Governance UX**  \n  GovTool has been a proving ground for UX/UI standards around proposal creation, DRep management, and transparency, patterns that can be adopted and extended elsewhere.  \n* **Low Friction for Forks & Experiments**  \n  The tool is intentionally designed to be forkable and customizable, encouraging parallel innovation across sidechains, testnets, and alternative governance models.  \n* **Community-Led Governance Culture**  \n  Supporting this proposal reinforces the narrative that Cardano governance tools should be open, adaptable, and stewarded by a global community and not centralized institutions.\n\nIn essence, GovTool is not just a governance frontend, rather it's an extensible foundation that makes it easier for others to build trustworthy, interoperable solutions across Cardano.",
          "motivation": "With CIP-1694 and the Voltaire era, Cardano governance is now in the hands of the community, but power without access is meaningless. Participation must be simple, inclusive, and equitable. GovTool provides the open, user-friendly experience needed for all Ada holders (existing and future) to register, delegate, propose, vote, and see outcomes transparently. Without it, participation risks becoming fragmented, exclusive, and dependent on closed-sourced or commercial tools, undermining decentralization. To safeguard Cardano\u2019s democratic legitimacy, we must maintain a reliable, neutral, open-source governance set of tools, fully community-owned, non-commercial, and free to access, built as public good. \n\nBuilt actively by 5 community builders, supported by many individual contributors, used by various other governance tools as basic infrastructure and by thousands of users, GovTool provides this  essential infrastructure for meaningful governance. \n\nGovtool current funding is set to expire at the end of June 2025 (*the current builders have however committed their time for an extra month and Intersect committed ADA 100k to either cover critical tasks or, if this proposal is approved, to be used to incentives further individual contribution to the open repositories of these applications*).\n\nThis updated proposal drafted via direct community input by the Cardano Govtool Consortium:\n\n* Reduces the total cost by almost half compared to the cost in the initial proposal  \n* Introduces a modular, tiered funding model with flexible scope, making development and maintenance costs clear and transparent  \n* Reinforces the decentralised structure of the Cardano Govtool and provides a clear plan to expand it to more contributors  \n* Supports community-led development via open and open-source contribution pathways  \n* Embeds substantial community feedback, captured through working groups, Discord discussions, submissions, public reviews and feedback sessions.",

          "title": "Amaru Treasury Withdrawal 2025",
          "abstract": "[Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) is an open-source project implementing a new fully interoperable block-producing node for Cardano. It aims to improve the network's overall accessibility and robustness without compromising its safety and security.\n\nThis treasury withdrawal of \u20b31.5M follows a previously submitted and now approved [budget proposal](https://explorer.cardano.org/tx/bd488931f792651fefa9c6fda185a2c6cec83245b51d994e33090ce36e29cc26). It is split across five script addresses each covering a scope of a work (ledger, consensus, mercenaries and marketing) and a contingency reserve.",
          "rationale": "## Administration of the budget\n\nThe [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) maintainer committee ensures **direct administration** of its budget, assisted by an **on-chain smart contract**. Off-chain, the fund management, responsibilities and remuneration of contributors follow [PRAGMA's Maintainer Committee Framework](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafkreiabxyva5lfm6zztg7tnktxvvbbucljrce7hlrp4p6hropqzfaip3y). Additionally, the smart contract's role is to ensure that funds are expended under the scope of work defined in this budget and authorized by the relevant scope owners.\n\nOur [final solution](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru-treasury) is built as an extension of the treasury management contract [presented by Sundae Labs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDSoc4sNxbM) in the context of a mission for Intersect. Our additions enable, most importantly, the dynamic definition of scope owners and their adjustment if necessary (e.g., key loss, departure, death) upon approval by the PRAGMA general assembly (requiring 5 signatures out of 5 members).\n\nWhile already [extensively](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru-treasury/blob/main/validators/permissions.test.ak) [tested](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru-treasury/blob/main/validators/traps.test.ak), our final solution is still being audited at the moment of writing this proposal. We do not wish to rush the auditors or take any risk regarding treasury management. \n\nHowever, due to time constraints stemming from the need to continue paying contributors whose payroll expires in the upcoming weeks, we have decided to proceed with a simplified setup and migrate to our final setup once it is ready.\n\nThe simplified setup relies entirely on the [initial solution designed and developed by Sundae Labs](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/), which has been extensively tested and fully audited by two independent parties (attached as external references to this proposal). We have also audited, tested and experimented with this solution on our own.\n\n### Initial setup\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pragma-org/amaru-treasury/fdf1981246cac9802c95191aec68a63567b73eed/.github/img/treasury-simplified-overview-dark.jpg)\n\nWe define 5 Amaru treasuries: one for each scope of work and one for the contingency budget. \n\nThe same smart contract governs each treasury, although it is configured differently in each case. It ensures funds coming from either UTxOs or reward accounts move according to specific operations with a precise semantic:\n\n- **reorganize**: allows for the collection and combination of multiple sources (e.g., multiple UTxOs) into another distribution with at least as many assets. This action is typically used to consolidate multiple UTxOs into a single one for easier treasury management.\n\n- **sweep**: after an agreed-upon expiration date, allows sending all ada leftovers (unconsumed budgets) back to the Cardano's treasury. Any native asset (e.g. USDM) is kept within the contract. The action can also be triggered at an earlier stage through a specific authorization.\n\n- **disburse**: allow payment of funds (ada or native assets) into an arbitrary address, up until the budget's expiration date. Only native assets can be disbursed beyond the expiration date to allow converting them back to ada.\n\n- **fund**: disburse funds into another set of on-chain validators ('vendors') pre-configured with a payment schedule. **We will not make use of this operation. It is fully disabled in our setup**. Disbursement will only happen through the _disburse_ action.\n\nIn addition to rules specified as part of the smart contract, each operation also defines a set of permissions. Permissions can take the form of a multisig or another script. \n\nIn the initial setup, we configure **each treasury** with permissions as follows:\n\n- The **reorganize** operation can be fully authorized by the respective scope owner alone. In the case of the _contingency_ budget, any scope owner is capable of authorizing a 'reorganize' operation. \n\n- The **sweep** operation requires 3 out of 4 authorizations until the end of 2025. It can be performed by *any ada holder* after that date.\n\n- **disburse** operation requires 3 out of 4 authorizations until the end of 2025. Disbursement of ada is forbidden after that date.  \n\n- The **fund** operation is entirely disabled using a permission setting that is impossible to satisfy.\n\n\n### Final setup\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pragma-org/amaru-treasury/8a6782c277e5ae6cc2ea446711bc33b6b56892ce/.github/img/treasury-overview-dark.jpg)\n\nIn a second phase, once the external audit has been finalized and our confidence in the contract is sufficient, we'll move towards our final vision for the 2025 budget management. This second solution is still smart-contract-based and builds upon the initial solution. \n\nIt is motivated by the desire to allow rotating credentials associated with scope owners to cope with two main issues:\n\n1. the loss of key from a scope owner;\n2. the departure of a scope owner from the project.\n\nRelying on a rigid setup which statically defines the scope owners is risky and unpractical. So instead, we recognize the following additional capabilities to the final solution:\n\n- **Credential rotation**: In case of loss of credentials or departure of a scope owner, a mechanism allows rotating credentials to new scope owners upon approval by all (5 out of 5) PRAGMA members.\n\n## Financial audit\n\nThe _'ad-hoc'_ scope of work makes provision for a financial auditor who will be picked at a later stage. \n\nTo facilitate the work of the auditor, we will attach metadata with key `1694` to transactions spending from the smart contracts, in accordance with [CIP-100](https://cips.cardano.org/cip/CIP-0100).\n\nInitial metadata describing each _Initial Setup(s)_ have already been published and are visible on-chain.\n\n| Scope / Budget | Transaction Id |\n| ---          | ---            | \n| Ledger       | [`cd25ce7b027fea4e28d5075691aa5822baa859bc74cc79db0377043bc9f383c7`](explorer.cardano.org/preview/tx/cd25ce7b027fea4e28d5075691aa5822baa859bc74cc79db0377043bc9f383c7) | \n| Consensus    | [`e5be93f2530c51e0b1582e5a0e99ccb1235e4395a41c7196d06c4daea3eafe66`](explorer.cardano.org/preview/tx/e5be93f2530c51e0b1582e5a0e99ccb1235e4395a41c7196d06c4daea3eafe66) |\n| Mercenaries  | [`0729a234e4e12b945f06189ca479681e49ffcc116fb3713720bada72180fe27c`](explorer.cardano.org/preview/tx/0729a234e4e12b945f06189ca479681e49ffcc116fb3713720bada72180fe27c) | \n| Marketing    | [`5697f433442317f04f539baecdf71fee01b3e8453c658a4d782648bc1e4f4490`](explorer.cardano.org/preview/tx/5697f433442317f04f539baecdf71fee01b3e8453c658a4d782648bc1e4f4490) | \n| Contingency  | [`44ae2c263b2115023e4b137f718549fcac78c0a59b7983e918d9e79d1a503b3c`](explorer.cardano.org/preview/tx/44ae2c263b2115023e4b137f718549fcac78c0a59b7983e918d9e79d1a503b3c) | \n\nTo further ease this process for the least technologically inclined, we will also collect in [a publicly available journal](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru-treasury/tree/main/journal#journal) an audit log of these transactions and a human-readable version of their metadata. \n\n## Constitutionality self-assessment\n\nBeing one of the first proposals of this nature ever submitted, it is easy to get things wrong. To convince ourselves of its constitutionality, we thought it relevant to include a checklist of the points we cover and, for each, our interpretation of the Cardano Constitution. \n\n#### Purpose\n\n- [x] This proposal is for work intended to enhance the security, decentralization and long-term sustainability of Cardano.\n\n#### Article III.5: on-chain governance process\n\n- [x] We have submitted this proposal in a standardized, legible format, which includes a URL and hash of all documented off-chain content. We believe our rationale to be detailed and sufficient. The proposal includes a title, abstract, rationale for the proposal, and relevant supporting materials.\n\n#### Article IV.1: budgets\n\n- [x] This proposal gives effect to the [previously presented and agreed upon budget](https://explorer.cardano.org/tx/9b62b3c632f329016a968ac25211825bb4f84b12461121c7da3aa11df92370f9), as indicated in this provision. \n\n#### Article IV.2: funds administration\n\n- [x] This proposal specifies an administrator in accordance with this provision. It also specifies an internal administration process using smart contracts and an off-chain overseeing committee, meeting the requirements of this clause, which requires a process that may include an administrator.\n\n#### Article IV.3: net-change limit\n\n- [x] Being of \u20b31.5M and taking place mid-2025, this withdrawal request does not violate the [currently agreed upon Net-Change Limit](https://explorer.cardano.org/tx/9b62b3c632f329016a968ac25211825bb4f84b12461121c7da3aa11df92370f9).\n\n#### Article IV.4: auditor & contractual obligations\n\n- [x] This proposal makes provisions for a financial auditor (covered by the _'ad-hoc'_ scope). The auditor will be picked at a later stage, and their work will be facilitated through the publication of metadata alongside any movement of funds out of the smart contracts.\n\n- [x] Our off-chain legal framework knwon as [PRAGMA's Maintainer Committee Framework](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafkreiabxyva5lfm6zztg7tnktxvvbbucljrce7hlrp4p6hropqzfaip3y) makes provision for a dispute resolution for contractors receiving an allocation in the context of this treasury withdrawal. It explicitly states that _\"Any dispute arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts of Zurich\"_. \n\n#### Article IV.5: vesting rules\n\n- [x] The use of intermediary smart contracts is used prior to any disbursement of funds to beneficiaries. In particular, we intend to attach on-chain metadata to facilitate financial audits.\n\n- [x] Our on-chain smart contract solution simultaneously enforces that:\n  1. funds (at the contract) cannot be delegated to an SPO; and\n  2. funds (at the contract) shall be delegated to an auto-abstain DRep.\n  \n  Note that we cannot prevent others from creating undelegated UTxOs at the contract's address. Yet, the contract stipulates that the outputs of each operation (e.g., reorganize) carry delegation rights in accordance with this provision.\n\n#### Guardrails\n\n- [x] TREASURY-01a - There's is currently an [approved Net-Change limit](https://explorer.cardano.org/tx/9b62b3c632f329016a968ac25211825bb4f84b12461121c7da3aa11df92370f9) of \u20b3350,000,000 finishing at the conclusion of Epoch 604 in December 2025.\n\n- [x] TREASURY-02a - At the moment of proposing this, there hasn't been any enacted treasury withdrawal for the current period covered by the Net-Change limit. Being of \u20b31.5M, this withdrawal is, at the moment of proposing it, within the Net-Change Limit. \n\n- [x] TREASURY-03a - This withdrawal is denominated in ada.\n\n- [x] TREASURY-04a - This withdrawal follows a [budget proposal](https://explorer.cardano.org/tx/bd488931f792651fefa9c6fda185a2c6cec83245b51d994e33090ce36e29cc26) that the DReps have agreed on with a threshold of greater than 50% of the active voting stake.\n\n## Notations & definitions\n\n- We denote 'ADA' as `\u20b3` throughout this proposal. We may use either notation interchangeably. \n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) project represents a major step towards node diversity through the development of a modular, high-performance, and interoperable block-producing node for Cardano. Our approach, rooted in openness, innovation, and operational resilience, aims to deliver significant advancements in blockchain technology without compromising on security.\n\nThis withdrawal aims to clearly outline a transparent budget management process, leveraging the capabilities of our chain to enforce this process as reasonably possible in the given timeframe. \n\nBeing an ongoing project, [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) comes with its own set of constraints. Yet, we try our best to pioneer what we think could be one of Cardano's most pivotal moments.",
          "motivation": "## Who we are\n\n[Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) is a multi-entity effort that currently sits under [PRAGMA](https://pragma.io): a member-based, not-for-profit association for open-source blockchain software projects. Five members with equal power currently drive PRAGMA's strategy and operations: Blink Labs, Cardano Foundation, dcSpark, Sundae Labs, and TxPipe. Each of them has a proven track record of building on Cardano and supporting our ecosystem.\n\n[Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru/graphs/contributors) itself is managed by an appointed maintainer committee in charge of different scopes. Each member of the maintainer committee is responsible for a scope of work and has oversight of its delivery, which includes managing the associated budget. The current maintainer committee comprises of:\n\n- [Matthias Benkort](https://github.com/ktorz) responsible for the **ledger & overall architecture** with a budget of 1.5 FTEs (**`\u20b3300,000`**) until end of 2025.\n\n  Managing treasury at: [`stake17xnev6rc25xwz8kg4qae8lq6dcg964z00py5gqgxd387pncv8fq8g`](https://cardanoscan.io/stakeKey/stake17xnev6rc25xwz8kg4qae8lq6dcg964z00py5gqgxd387pncv8fq8g)\n\n- [Arnaud Bailly](https://github.com/abailly) responsible for the **consensus and simulation testing**, with a budget of 1.5 FTEs (**`\u20b3300,000`**) until end of 2025.\n  \n  Managing treasury at: [`stake17xd74ehu0l4d5mx0sfz4fd0r5jvw4v2jqkkfyjxrlwvnkhccrqj9l`](https://cardanoscan.io/stakeKey/stake17xd74ehu0l4d5mx0sfz4fd0r5jvw4v2jqkkfyjxrlwvnkhccrqj9l)\n\n- [Pi Lanningham](https://github.com/Quantumplation) responsible for the **ad hoc work and middleware integrations** (a.k.a mercenaries) with a budget of 2.5 FTEs (**`\u20b3500,000`**) until end of 2025.\n\n  Managing treasury at: [`stake17xrh74lqhhxgzelfsn0wq5kcm4e5dmluprlcpg5mq30p5yqhgk7k8`](https://cardanoscan.io/stakeKey/stake17xrh74lqhhxgzelfsn0wq5kcm4e5dmluprlcpg5mq30p5yqhgk7k8)\n\n- [Damien Czapla](https://github.com/Dam-CZ) responsible for the **project management, public relations & marketing** with a budget of 0.5 FTE (**`\u20b3100,000`**) until end of 2025.\n\n  Managing treasury at: [`stake17xrqac8khkprtpp2jz90mpkujjwye8dt6a9sjewrvjudx9ggg4u5y`](https://cardanoscan.io/stakeKey/stake17xrqac8khkprtpp2jz90mpkujjwye8dt6a9sjewrvjudx9ggg4u5y)\n\n- [Santiago Carmuega](https://github.com/scarmuega) responsible for the **p2p networking**. Santiago oversees **no part of the treasury budget** whatsoever related to Amaru in 2025. The networking's funding has been fully secured through other mechanisms.\n\nAdditionally, Arnaud, Matthias, Pi and Damien are collectively responsible for the _contingency_ scope with a budget of **`\u20b3300,000`** until the end of 2025, corresponding to 25% of the sum of all other budgets as outlined in the [budget proposal](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafkreibqma7t2k4rcywvx5afukahhi3dp2so2ugh7t4ljuawhanvk7sr34).\n\nThe contingency treasury's stake address is: [`stake178jztxzwynajcp4dva5gy9udmmnwg7ueffvf4c7hpjqhc7gtj5nzz`](https://cardanoscan.io/stakeKey/stake178jztxzwynajcp4dva5gy9udmmnwg7ueffvf4c7hpjqhc7gtj5nzz)\n\n---\n\nIn total, we request **`\u20b31,500,000`** (1.5M ADA).\n\n---\n\n> **NOTES**\n>\n> 1. Efforts are estimated in FTE (Full-Time Employee) valued at $200K / \u20b3400K per annum.\n>\n> 2. As outlined in the initial budget proposal, the withdrawal requests only account for resources that aren't currently covered by other means (e.g. sponsorship, employee payroll, Catalyst, ...). In particular, every scope owner highlighted above is fully covered **outside** of this withdrawal.\n\n## Building an alternative node\n\n[Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) provides an alternative perspective and solution for both stake pool operators and developers, prioritizing a modular approach, a seamless user experience, and low hardware requirements. Additionally, the project is primarily implemented in Rust, which is well-suited for high assurance, thereby attracting new contributors to the core maintenance of the ecosystem.\n\nFor more details, please refer to the [budget proposal](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafybeicyqwjcg4x52l4ml5ocjlqnproqdjgfbguxdge4saxxvu2hidzvpq) which already covers in great length the project, its goals, its deliverables and its methodology\n\n## Why request funds from Cardano's treasury\n\n### Decentralized core infrastructure\n\nBlock-producing nodes (a.k.a. stake pools) and relays are at the heart of Cardano's infrastructure. Together, they constitute and support the Cardano network. [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) aims at offering an alternative piece to this core infrastructure, thus becoming part of this core infrastructure. We firmly believe that decentralizing the core infrastructure\u2014without disrupting its operational resilience\u2014is a necessary step toward a more robust and secure network.\n\nAdditionally, supporting the blockchain base layer should be a shared responsibility. Stakepool operators already share the burden of operating the network, and it is time to share the responsibility for its development and technical evolution. [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) makes a significant leap in sharing this responsibility, not only by incrementally delivering a capable block-producing node for the network but also by paving the way for those who come after through documentation, conformance tests and engineering specifications.\n\nBy its very nature, [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) is a project that aligns with Cardano's vision. As a core infrastructure component, it is also challenging and undesirable to articulate a business model around the project without compromising its essence. We believe that because of these reasons, [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) qualifies for treasury withdrawals.\n\n### Open source & neutrality\n\nThe project is, of course, open source. We have linked [the code repository](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) throughout this document and referred to it also in the original budget proposal. As outlined in the budget proposal, not only is the code public, but the project's progress, evolutions, and decisions are also publicly available. The team strives to remain accessible through public forums and regular touchpoints open to all.\n\nThe core team comprises individuals from various entities and backgrounds. And, while not obvious, this is a situation very dear to us. To preserve Amaru's neutrality and openness, we must ensure that core contributors are not tied to a single actor. Cardano's treasury offers a perfect solution to this problem as it virtually represents a source of funding that is _\"everyone and no one at the same time\"_.\n\nReceiving funding from the Cardano treasury makes the [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) team accountable towards the Cardano community. It turns the Cardano community into our ultimate stakeholder, which is both good and desirable for a project of this nature.",

          "title": "Amaru Treasury Withdrawal 2025",
          "abstract": "[Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) is an open-source project implementing a new fully interoperable block-producing node for Cardano. It aims to improve the network's overall accessibility and robustness without compromising its safety and security.\n\nThis treasury withdrawal of \u20b31.5M follows a previously submitted and now approved [budget proposal](https://explorer.cardano.org/tx/bd488931f792651fefa9c6fda185a2c6cec83245b51d994e33090ce36e29cc26). It is split across five script addresses each covering a scope of a work (ledger, consensus, mercenaries and marketing) and a contingency reserve.",
          "rationale": "## Administration of the budget\n\nThe [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) maintainer committee ensures **direct administration** of its budget, assisted by an **on-chain smart contract**. Off-chain, the fund management, responsibilities and remuneration of contributors follow [PRAGMA's Maintainer Committee Framework](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafkreiabxyva5lfm6zztg7tnktxvvbbucljrce7hlrp4p6hropqzfaip3y). Additionally, the smart contract's role is to ensure that funds are expended under the scope of work defined in this budget and authorized by the relevant scope owners.\n\nOur [final solution](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru-treasury) is built as an extension of the treasury management contract [presented by Sundae Labs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDSoc4sNxbM) in the context of a mission for Intersect. Our additions enable, most importantly, the dynamic definition of scope owners and their adjustment if necessary (e.g., key loss, departure, death) upon approval by the PRAGMA general assembly (requiring 5 signatures out of 5 members).\n\nWhile already [extensively](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru-treasury/blob/main/validators/permissions.test.ak) [tested](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru-treasury/blob/main/validators/traps.test.ak), our final solution is still being audited at the moment of writing this proposal. We do not wish to rush the auditors or take any risk regarding treasury management. \n\nHowever, due to time constraints stemming from the need to continue paying contributors whose payroll expires in the upcoming weeks, we have decided to proceed with a simplified setup and migrate to our final setup once it is ready.\n\nThe simplified setup relies entirely on the [initial solution designed and developed by Sundae Labs](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/), which has been extensively tested and fully audited by two independent parties (attached as external references to this proposal). We have also audited, tested and experimented with this solution on our own.\n\n### Initial setup\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pragma-org/amaru-treasury/fdf1981246cac9802c95191aec68a63567b73eed/.github/img/treasury-simplified-overview-dark.jpg)\n\nWe define 5 Amaru treasuries: one for each scope of work and one for the contingency budget. \n\nThe same smart contract governs each treasury, although it is configured differently in each case. It ensures funds coming from either UTxOs or reward accounts move according to specific operations with a precise semantic:\n\n- **reorganize**: allows for the collection and combination of multiple sources (e.g., multiple UTxOs) into another distribution with at least as many assets. This action is typically used to consolidate multiple UTxOs into a single one for easier treasury management.\n\n- **sweep**: after an agreed-upon expiration date, allows sending all ada leftovers (unconsumed budgets) back to the Cardano's treasury. Any native asset (e.g. USDM) is kept within the contract. The action can also be triggered at an earlier stage through a specific authorization.\n\n- **disburse**: allow payment of funds (ada or native assets) into an arbitrary address, up until the budget's expiration date. Only native assets can be disbursed beyond the expiration date to allow converting them back to ada.\n\n- **fund**: disburse funds into another set of on-chain validators ('vendors') pre-configured with a payment schedule. **We will not make use of this operation. It is fully disabled in our setup**. Disbursement will only happen through the _disburse_ action.\n\nIn addition to rules specified as part of the smart contract, each operation also defines a set of permissions. Permissions can take the form of a multisig or another script. \n\nIn the initial setup, we configure **each treasury** with permissions as follows:\n\n- The **reorganize** operation can be fully authorized by the respective scope owner alone. In the case of the _contingency_ budget, any scope owner is capable of authorizing a 'reorganize' operation. \n\n- The **sweep** operation requires 3 out of 4 authorizations until the end of 2025. It can be performed by *any ada holder* after that date.\n\n- **disburse** operation requires 3 out of 4 authorizations until the end of 2025. Disbursement of ada is forbidden after that date.  \n\n- The **fund** operation is entirely disabled using a permission setting that is impossible to satisfy.\n\n\n### Final setup\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pragma-org/amaru-treasury/8a6782c277e5ae6cc2ea446711bc33b6b56892ce/.github/img/treasury-overview-dark.jpg)\n\nIn a second phase, once the external audit has been finalized and our confidence in the contract is sufficient, we'll move towards our final vision for the 2025 budget management. This second solution is still smart-contract-based and builds upon the initial solution. \n\nIt is motivated by the desire to allow rotating credentials associated with scope owners to cope with two main issues:\n\n1. the loss of key from a scope owner;\n2. the departure of a scope owner from the project.\n\nRelying on a rigid setup which statically defines the scope owners is risky and unpractical. So instead, we recognize the following additional capabilities to the final solution:\n\n- **Credential rotation**: In case of loss of credentials or departure of a scope owner, a mechanism allows rotating credentials to new scope owners upon approval by all (5 out of 5) PRAGMA members.\n\n## Financial audit\n\nThe _'ad-hoc'_ scope of work makes provision for a financial auditor who will be picked at a later stage. \n\nTo facilitate the work of the auditor, we will attach metadata with key `1694` to transactions spending from the smart contracts, in accordance with [CIP-100](https://cips.cardano.org/cip/CIP-0100).\n\nInitial metadata describing each _Initial Setup(s)_ have already been published and are visible on-chain.\n\n| Scope / Budget | Transaction Id |\n| ---          | ---            | \n| Ledger       | [`cd25ce7b027fea4e28d5075691aa5822baa859bc74cc79db0377043bc9f383c7`](explorer.cardano.org/preview/tx/cd25ce7b027fea4e28d5075691aa5822baa859bc74cc79db0377043bc9f383c7) | \n| Consensus    | [`e5be93f2530c51e0b1582e5a0e99ccb1235e4395a41c7196d06c4daea3eafe66`](explorer.cardano.org/preview/tx/e5be93f2530c51e0b1582e5a0e99ccb1235e4395a41c7196d06c4daea3eafe66) |\n| Mercenaries  | [`0729a234e4e12b945f06189ca479681e49ffcc116fb3713720bada72180fe27c`](explorer.cardano.org/preview/tx/0729a234e4e12b945f06189ca479681e49ffcc116fb3713720bada72180fe27c) | \n| Marketing    | [`5697f433442317f04f539baecdf71fee01b3e8453c658a4d782648bc1e4f4490`](explorer.cardano.org/preview/tx/5697f433442317f04f539baecdf71fee01b3e8453c658a4d782648bc1e4f4490) | \n| Contingency  | [`44ae2c263b2115023e4b137f718549fcac78c0a59b7983e918d9e79d1a503b3c`](explorer.cardano.org/preview/tx/44ae2c263b2115023e4b137f718549fcac78c0a59b7983e918d9e79d1a503b3c) | \n\nTo further ease this process for the least technologically inclined, we will also collect in [a publicly available journal](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru-treasury/tree/main/journal#journal) an audit log of these transactions and a human-readable version of their metadata. \n\n## Constitutionality self-assessment\n\nBeing one of the first proposals of this nature ever submitted, it is easy to get things wrong. To convince ourselves of its constitutionality, we thought it relevant to include a checklist of the points we cover and, for each, our interpretation of the Cardano Constitution. \n\n#### Purpose\n\n- [x] This proposal is for work intended to enhance the security, decentralization and long-term sustainability of Cardano.\n\n#### Article III.5: on-chain governance process\n\n- [x] We have submitted this proposal in a standardized, legible format, which includes a URL and hash of all documented off-chain content. We believe our rationale to be detailed and sufficient. The proposal includes a title, abstract, rationale for the proposal, and relevant supporting materials.\n\n#### Article IV.1: budgets\n\n- [x] This proposal gives effect to the [previously presented and agreed upon budget](https://explorer.cardano.org/tx/9b62b3c632f329016a968ac25211825bb4f84b12461121c7da3aa11df92370f9), as indicated in this provision. \n\n#### Article IV.2: funds administration\n\n- [x] This proposal specifies an administrator in accordance with this provision. It also specifies an internal administration process using smart contracts and an off-chain overseeing committee, meeting the requirements of this clause, which requires a process that may include an administrator.\n\n#### Article IV.3: net-change limit\n\n- [x] Being of \u20b31.5M and taking place mid-2025, this withdrawal request does not violate the [currently agreed upon Net-Change Limit](https://explorer.cardano.org/tx/9b62b3c632f329016a968ac25211825bb4f84b12461121c7da3aa11df92370f9).\n\n#### Article IV.4: auditor & contractual obligations\n\n- [x] This proposal makes provisions for a financial auditor (covered by the _'ad-hoc'_ scope). The auditor will be picked at a later stage, and their work will be facilitated through the publication of metadata alongside any movement of funds out of the smart contracts.\n\n- [x] Our off-chain legal framework knwon as [PRAGMA's Maintainer Committee Framework](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafkreiabxyva5lfm6zztg7tnktxvvbbucljrce7hlrp4p6hropqzfaip3y) makes provision for a dispute resolution for contractors receiving an allocation in the context of this treasury withdrawal. It explicitly states that _\"Any dispute arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts of Zurich\"_. \n\n#### Article IV.5: vesting rules\n\n- [x] The use of intermediary smart contracts is used prior to any disbursement of funds to beneficiaries. In particular, we intend to attach on-chain metadata to facilitate financial audits.\n\n- [x] Our on-chain smart contract solution simultaneously enforces that:\n  1. funds (at the contract) cannot be delegated to an SPO; and\n  2. funds (at the contract) shall be delegated to an auto-abstain DRep.\n  \n  Note that we cannot prevent others from creating undelegated UTxOs at the contract's address. Yet, the contract stipulates that the outputs of each operation (e.g., reorganize) carry delegation rights in accordance with this provision.\n\n#### Guardrails\n\n- [x] TREASURY-01a - There's is currently an [approved Net-Change limit](https://explorer.cardano.org/tx/9b62b3c632f329016a968ac25211825bb4f84b12461121c7da3aa11df92370f9) of \u20b3350,000,000 finishing at the conclusion of Epoch 604 in December 2025.\n\n- [x] TREASURY-02a - At the moment of proposing this, there hasn't been any enacted treasury withdrawal for the current period covered by the Net-Change limit. Being of \u20b31.5M, this withdrawal is, at the moment of proposing it, within the Net-Change Limit. \n\n- [x] TREASURY-03a - This withdrawal is denominated in ada.\n\n- [x] TREASURY-04a - This withdrawal follows a [budget proposal](https://explorer.cardano.org/tx/bd488931f792651fefa9c6fda185a2c6cec83245b51d994e33090ce36e29cc26) that the DReps have agreed on with a threshold of greater than 50% of the active voting stake.\n\n## Notations & definitions\n\n- We denote 'ADA' as `\u20b3` throughout this proposal. We may use either notation interchangeably. \n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) project represents a major step towards node diversity through the development of a modular, high-performance, and interoperable block-producing node for Cardano. Our approach, rooted in openness, innovation, and operational resilience, aims to deliver significant advancements in blockchain technology without compromising on security.\n\nThis withdrawal aims to clearly outline a transparent budget management process, leveraging the capabilities of our chain to enforce this process as reasonably possible in the given timeframe. \n\nBeing an ongoing project, [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) comes with its own set of constraints. Yet, we try our best to pioneer what we think could be one of Cardano's most pivotal moments.",
          "motivation": "## Who we are\n\n[Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) is a multi-entity effort that currently sits under [PRAGMA](https://pragma.io): a member-based, not-for-profit association for open-source blockchain software projects. Five members with equal power currently drive PRAGMA's strategy and operations: Blink Labs, Cardano Foundation, dcSpark, Sundae Labs, and TxPipe. Each of them has a proven track record of building on Cardano and supporting our ecosystem.\n\n[Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru/graphs/contributors) itself is managed by an appointed maintainer committee in charge of different scopes. Each member of the maintainer committee is responsible for a scope of work and has oversight of its delivery, which includes managing the associated budget. The current maintainer committee comprises of:\n\n- [Matthias Benkort](https://github.com/ktorz) responsible for the **ledger & overall architecture** with a budget of 1.5 FTEs (**`\u20b3300,000`**) until end of 2025.\n\n  Managing treasury at: [`stake17xnev6rc25xwz8kg4qae8lq6dcg964z00py5gqgxd387pncv8fq8g`](https://cardanoscan.io/stakeKey/stake17xnev6rc25xwz8kg4qae8lq6dcg964z00py5gqgxd387pncv8fq8g)\n\n- [Arnaud Bailly](https://github.com/abailly) responsible for the **consensus and simulation testing**, with a budget of 1.5 FTEs (**`\u20b3300,000`**) until end of 2025.\n  \n  Managing treasury at: [`stake17xd74ehu0l4d5mx0sfz4fd0r5jvw4v2jqkkfyjxrlwvnkhccrqj9l`](https://cardanoscan.io/stakeKey/stake17xd74ehu0l4d5mx0sfz4fd0r5jvw4v2jqkkfyjxrlwvnkhccrqj9l)\n\n- [Pi Lanningham](https://github.com/Quantumplation) responsible for the **ad hoc work and middleware integrations** (a.k.a mercenaries) with a budget of 2.5 FTEs (**`\u20b3500,000`**) until end of 2025.\n\n  Managing treasury at: [`stake17xrh74lqhhxgzelfsn0wq5kcm4e5dmluprlcpg5mq30p5yqhgk7k8`](https://cardanoscan.io/stakeKey/stake17xrh74lqhhxgzelfsn0wq5kcm4e5dmluprlcpg5mq30p5yqhgk7k8)\n\n- [Damien Czapla](https://github.com/Dam-CZ) responsible for the **project management, public relations & marketing** with a budget of 0.5 FTE (**`\u20b3100,000`**) until end of 2025.\n\n  Managing treasury at: [`stake17xrqac8khkprtpp2jz90mpkujjwye8dt6a9sjewrvjudx9ggg4u5y`](https://cardanoscan.io/stakeKey/stake17xrqac8khkprtpp2jz90mpkujjwye8dt6a9sjewrvjudx9ggg4u5y)\n\n- [Santiago Carmuega](https://github.com/scarmuega) responsible for the **p2p networking**. Santiago oversees **no part of the treasury budget** whatsoever related to Amaru in 2025. The networking's funding has been fully secured through other mechanisms.\n\nAdditionally, Arnaud, Matthias, Pi and Damien are collectively responsible for the _contingency_ scope with a budget of **`\u20b3300,000`** until the end of 2025, corresponding to 25% of the sum of all other budgets as outlined in the [budget proposal](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafkreibqma7t2k4rcywvx5afukahhi3dp2so2ugh7t4ljuawhanvk7sr34).\n\nThe contingency treasury's stake address is: [`stake178jztxzwynajcp4dva5gy9udmmnwg7ueffvf4c7hpjqhc7gtj5nzz`](https://cardanoscan.io/stakeKey/stake178jztxzwynajcp4dva5gy9udmmnwg7ueffvf4c7hpjqhc7gtj5nzz)\n\n---\n\nIn total, we request **`\u20b31,500,000`** (1.5M ADA).\n\n---\n\n> **NOTES**\n>\n> 1. Efforts are estimated in FTE (Full-Time Employee) valued at $200K / \u20b3400K per annum.\n>\n> 2. As outlined in the initial budget proposal, the withdrawal requests only account for resources that aren't currently covered by other means (e.g. sponsorship, employee payroll, Catalyst, ...). In particular, every scope owner highlighted above is fully covered **outside** of this withdrawal.\n\n## Building an alternative node\n\n[Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) provides an alternative perspective and solution for both stake pool operators and developers, prioritizing a modular approach, a seamless user experience, and low hardware requirements. Additionally, the project is primarily implemented in Rust, which is well-suited for high assurance, thereby attracting new contributors to the core maintenance of the ecosystem.\n\nFor more details, please refer to the [budget proposal](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafybeicyqwjcg4x52l4ml5ocjlqnproqdjgfbguxdge4saxxvu2hidzvpq) which already covers in great length the project, its goals, its deliverables and its methodology\n\n## Why request funds from Cardano's treasury\n\n### Decentralized core infrastructure\n\nBlock-producing nodes (a.k.a. stake pools) and relays are at the heart of Cardano's infrastructure. Together, they constitute and support the Cardano network. [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) aims at offering an alternative piece to this core infrastructure, thus becoming part of this core infrastructure. We firmly believe that decentralizing the core infrastructure\u2014without disrupting its operational resilience\u2014is a necessary step toward a more robust and secure network.\n\nAdditionally, supporting the blockchain base layer should be a shared responsibility. Stakepool operators already share the burden of operating the network, and it is time to share the responsibility for its development and technical evolution. [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) makes a significant leap in sharing this responsibility, not only by incrementally delivering a capable block-producing node for the network but also by paving the way for those who come after through documentation, conformance tests and engineering specifications.\n\nBy its very nature, [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) is a project that aligns with Cardano's vision. As a core infrastructure component, it is also challenging and undesirable to articulate a business model around the project without compromising its essence. We believe that because of these reasons, [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) qualifies for treasury withdrawals.\n\n### Open source & neutrality\n\nThe project is, of course, open source. We have linked [the code repository](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) throughout this document and referred to it also in the original budget proposal. As outlined in the budget proposal, not only is the code public, but the project's progress, evolutions, and decisions are also publicly available. The team strives to remain accessible through public forums and regular touchpoints open to all.\n\nThe core team comprises individuals from various entities and backgrounds. And, while not obvious, this is a situation very dear to us. To preserve Amaru's neutrality and openness, we must ensure that core contributors are not tied to a single actor. Cardano's treasury offers a perfect solution to this problem as it virtually represents a source of funding that is _\"everyone and no one at the same time\"_.\n\nReceiving funding from the Cardano treasury makes the [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) team accountable towards the Cardano community. It turns the Cardano community into our ultimate stakeholder, which is both good and desirable for a project of this nature.",

          "title": "Amaru Treasury Withdrawal 2025",
          "abstract": "[Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) is an open-source project implementing a new fully interoperable block-producing node for Cardano. It aims to improve the network's overall accessibility and robustness without compromising its safety and security.\n\nThis treasury withdrawal of \u20b31.5M follows a previously submitted and now approved [budget proposal](https://explorer.cardano.org/tx/bd488931f792651fefa9c6fda185a2c6cec83245b51d994e33090ce36e29cc26). It is split across five script addresses each covering a scope of a work (ledger, consensus, mercenaries and marketing) and a contingency reserve.",
          "rationale": "## Administration of the budget\n\nThe [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) maintainer committee ensures **direct administration** of its budget, assisted by an **on-chain smart contract**. Off-chain, the fund management, responsibilities and remuneration of contributors follow [PRAGMA's Maintainer Committee Framework](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafkreiabxyva5lfm6zztg7tnktxvvbbucljrce7hlrp4p6hropqzfaip3y). Additionally, the smart contract's role is to ensure that funds are expended under the scope of work defined in this budget and authorized by the relevant scope owners.\n\nOur [final solution](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru-treasury) is built as an extension of the treasury management contract [presented by Sundae Labs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDSoc4sNxbM) in the context of a mission for Intersect. Our additions enable, most importantly, the dynamic definition of scope owners and their adjustment if necessary (e.g., key loss, departure, death) upon approval by the PRAGMA general assembly (requiring 5 signatures out of 5 members).\n\nWhile already [extensively](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru-treasury/blob/main/validators/permissions.test.ak) [tested](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru-treasury/blob/main/validators/traps.test.ak), our final solution is still being audited at the moment of writing this proposal. We do not wish to rush the auditors or take any risk regarding treasury management. \n\nHowever, due to time constraints stemming from the need to continue paying contributors whose payroll expires in the upcoming weeks, we have decided to proceed with a simplified setup and migrate to our final setup once it is ready.\n\nThe simplified setup relies entirely on the [initial solution designed and developed by Sundae Labs](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/), which has been extensively tested and fully audited by two independent parties (attached as external references to this proposal). We have also audited, tested and experimented with this solution on our own.\n\n### Initial setup\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pragma-org/amaru-treasury/fdf1981246cac9802c95191aec68a63567b73eed/.github/img/treasury-simplified-overview-dark.jpg)\n\nWe define 5 Amaru treasuries: one for each scope of work and one for the contingency budget. \n\nThe same smart contract governs each treasury, although it is configured differently in each case. It ensures funds coming from either UTxOs or reward accounts move according to specific operations with a precise semantic:\n\n- **reorganize**: allows for the collection and combination of multiple sources (e.g., multiple UTxOs) into another distribution with at least as many assets. This action is typically used to consolidate multiple UTxOs into a single one for easier treasury management.\n\n- **sweep**: after an agreed-upon expiration date, allows sending all ada leftovers (unconsumed budgets) back to the Cardano's treasury. Any native asset (e.g. USDM) is kept within the contract. The action can also be triggered at an earlier stage through a specific authorization.\n\n- **disburse**: allow payment of funds (ada or native assets) into an arbitrary address, up until the budget's expiration date. Only native assets can be disbursed beyond the expiration date to allow converting them back to ada.\n\n- **fund**: disburse funds into another set of on-chain validators ('vendors') pre-configured with a payment schedule. **We will not make use of this operation. It is fully disabled in our setup**. Disbursement will only happen through the _disburse_ action.\n\nIn addition to rules specified as part of the smart contract, each operation also defines a set of permissions. Permissions can take the form of a multisig or another script. \n\nIn the initial setup, we configure **each treasury** with permissions as follows:\n\n- The **reorganize** operation can be fully authorized by the respective scope owner alone. In the case of the _contingency_ budget, any scope owner is capable of authorizing a 'reorganize' operation. \n\n- The **sweep** operation requires 3 out of 4 authorizations until the end of 2025. It can be performed by *any ada holder* after that date.\n\n- **disburse** operation requires 3 out of 4 authorizations until the end of 2025. Disbursement of ada is forbidden after that date.  \n\n- The **fund** operation is entirely disabled using a permission setting that is impossible to satisfy.\n\n\n### Final setup\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pragma-org/amaru-treasury/8a6782c277e5ae6cc2ea446711bc33b6b56892ce/.github/img/treasury-overview-dark.jpg)\n\nIn a second phase, once the external audit has been finalized and our confidence in the contract is sufficient, we'll move towards our final vision for the 2025 budget management. This second solution is still smart-contract-based and builds upon the initial solution. \n\nIt is motivated by the desire to allow rotating credentials associated with scope owners to cope with two main issues:\n\n1. the loss of key from a scope owner;\n2. the departure of a scope owner from the project.\n\nRelying on a rigid setup which statically defines the scope owners is risky and unpractical. So instead, we recognize the following additional capabilities to the final solution:\n\n- **Credential rotation**: In case of loss of credentials or departure of a scope owner, a mechanism allows rotating credentials to new scope owners upon approval by all (5 out of 5) PRAGMA members.\n\n## Financial audit\n\nThe _'ad-hoc'_ scope of work makes provision for a financial auditor who will be picked at a later stage. \n\nTo facilitate the work of the auditor, we will attach metadata with key `1694` to transactions spending from the smart contracts, in accordance with [CIP-100](https://cips.cardano.org/cip/CIP-0100).\n\nInitial metadata describing each _Initial Setup(s)_ have already been published and are visible on-chain.\n\n| Scope / Budget | Transaction Id |\n| ---          | ---            | \n| Ledger       | [`cd25ce7b027fea4e28d5075691aa5822baa859bc74cc79db0377043bc9f383c7`](explorer.cardano.org/preview/tx/cd25ce7b027fea4e28d5075691aa5822baa859bc74cc79db0377043bc9f383c7) | \n| Consensus    | [`e5be93f2530c51e0b1582e5a0e99ccb1235e4395a41c7196d06c4daea3eafe66`](explorer.cardano.org/preview/tx/e5be93f2530c51e0b1582e5a0e99ccb1235e4395a41c7196d06c4daea3eafe66) |\n| Mercenaries  | [`0729a234e4e12b945f06189ca479681e49ffcc116fb3713720bada72180fe27c`](explorer.cardano.org/preview/tx/0729a234e4e12b945f06189ca479681e49ffcc116fb3713720bada72180fe27c) | \n| Marketing    | [`5697f433442317f04f539baecdf71fee01b3e8453c658a4d782648bc1e4f4490`](explorer.cardano.org/preview/tx/5697f433442317f04f539baecdf71fee01b3e8453c658a4d782648bc1e4f4490) | \n| Contingency  | [`44ae2c263b2115023e4b137f718549fcac78c0a59b7983e918d9e79d1a503b3c`](explorer.cardano.org/preview/tx/44ae2c263b2115023e4b137f718549fcac78c0a59b7983e918d9e79d1a503b3c) | \n\nTo further ease this process for the least technologically inclined, we will also collect in [a publicly available journal](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru-treasury/tree/main/journal#journal) an audit log of these transactions and a human-readable version of their metadata. \n\n## Constitutionality self-assessment\n\nBeing one of the first proposals of this nature ever submitted, it is easy to get things wrong. To convince ourselves of its constitutionality, we thought it relevant to include a checklist of the points we cover and, for each, our interpretation of the Cardano Constitution. \n\n#### Purpose\n\n- [x] This proposal is for work intended to enhance the security, decentralization and long-term sustainability of Cardano.\n\n#### Article III.5: on-chain governance process\n\n- [x] We have submitted this proposal in a standardized, legible format, which includes a URL and hash of all documented off-chain content. We believe our rationale to be detailed and sufficient. The proposal includes a title, abstract, rationale for the proposal, and relevant supporting materials.\n\n#### Article IV.1: budgets\n\n- [x] This proposal gives effect to the [previously presented and agreed upon budget](https://explorer.cardano.org/tx/9b62b3c632f329016a968ac25211825bb4f84b12461121c7da3aa11df92370f9), as indicated in this provision. \n\n#### Article IV.2: funds administration\n\n- [x] This proposal specifies an administrator in accordance with this provision. It also specifies an internal administration process using smart contracts and an off-chain overseeing committee, meeting the requirements of this clause, which requires a process that may include an administrator.\n\n#### Article IV.3: net-change limit\n\n- [x] Being of \u20b31.5M and taking place mid-2025, this withdrawal request does not violate the [currently agreed upon Net-Change Limit](https://explorer.cardano.org/tx/9b62b3c632f329016a968ac25211825bb4f84b12461121c7da3aa11df92370f9).\n\n#### Article IV.4: auditor & contractual obligations\n\n- [x] This proposal makes provisions for a financial auditor (covered by the _'ad-hoc'_ scope). The auditor will be picked at a later stage, and their work will be facilitated through the publication of metadata alongside any movement of funds out of the smart contracts.\n\n- [x] Our off-chain legal framework knwon as [PRAGMA's Maintainer Committee Framework](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafkreiabxyva5lfm6zztg7tnktxvvbbucljrce7hlrp4p6hropqzfaip3y) makes provision for a dispute resolution for contractors receiving an allocation in the context of this treasury withdrawal. It explicitly states that _\"Any dispute arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts of Zurich\"_. \n\n#### Article IV.5: vesting rules\n\n- [x] The use of intermediary smart contracts is used prior to any disbursement of funds to beneficiaries. In particular, we intend to attach on-chain metadata to facilitate financial audits.\n\n- [x] Our on-chain smart contract solution simultaneously enforces that:\n  1. funds (at the contract) cannot be delegated to an SPO; and\n  2. funds (at the contract) shall be delegated to an auto-abstain DRep.\n  \n  Note that we cannot prevent others from creating undelegated UTxOs at the contract's address. Yet, the contract stipulates that the outputs of each operation (e.g., reorganize) carry delegation rights in accordance with this provision.\n\n#### Guardrails\n\n- [x] TREASURY-01a - There's is currently an [approved Net-Change limit](https://explorer.cardano.org/tx/9b62b3c632f329016a968ac25211825bb4f84b12461121c7da3aa11df92370f9) of \u20b3350,000,000 finishing at the conclusion of Epoch 604 in December 2025.\n\n- [x] TREASURY-02a - At the moment of proposing this, there hasn't been any enacted treasury withdrawal for the current period covered by the Net-Change limit. Being of \u20b31.5M, this withdrawal is, at the moment of proposing it, within the Net-Change Limit. \n\n- [x] TREASURY-03a - This withdrawal is denominated in ada.\n\n- [x] TREASURY-04a - This withdrawal follows a [budget proposal](https://explorer.cardano.org/tx/bd488931f792651fefa9c6fda185a2c6cec83245b51d994e33090ce36e29cc26) that the DReps have agreed on with a threshold of greater than 50% of the active voting stake.\n\n## Notations & definitions\n\n- We denote 'ADA' as `\u20b3` throughout this proposal. We may use either notation interchangeably. \n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) project represents a major step towards node diversity through the development of a modular, high-performance, and interoperable block-producing node for Cardano. Our approach, rooted in openness, innovation, and operational resilience, aims to deliver significant advancements in blockchain technology without compromising on security.\n\nThis withdrawal aims to clearly outline a transparent budget management process, leveraging the capabilities of our chain to enforce this process as reasonably possible in the given timeframe. \n\nBeing an ongoing project, [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) comes with its own set of constraints. Yet, we try our best to pioneer what we think could be one of Cardano's most pivotal moments.",
          "motivation": "## Who we are\n\n[Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) is a multi-entity effort that currently sits under [PRAGMA](https://pragma.io): a member-based, not-for-profit association for open-source blockchain software projects. Five members with equal power currently drive PRAGMA's strategy and operations: Blink Labs, Cardano Foundation, dcSpark, Sundae Labs, and TxPipe. Each of them has a proven track record of building on Cardano and supporting our ecosystem.\n\n[Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru/graphs/contributors) itself is managed by an appointed maintainer committee in charge of different scopes. Each member of the maintainer committee is responsible for a scope of work and has oversight of its delivery, which includes managing the associated budget. The current maintainer committee comprises of:\n\n- [Matthias Benkort](https://github.com/ktorz) responsible for the **ledger & overall architecture** with a budget of 1.5 FTEs (**`\u20b3300,000`**) until end of 2025.\n\n  Managing treasury at: [`stake17xnev6rc25xwz8kg4qae8lq6dcg964z00py5gqgxd387pncv8fq8g`](https://cardanoscan.io/stakeKey/stake17xnev6rc25xwz8kg4qae8lq6dcg964z00py5gqgxd387pncv8fq8g)\n\n- [Arnaud Bailly](https://github.com/abailly) responsible for the **consensus and simulation testing**, with a budget of 1.5 FTEs (**`\u20b3300,000`**) until end of 2025.\n  \n  Managing treasury at: [`stake17xd74ehu0l4d5mx0sfz4fd0r5jvw4v2jqkkfyjxrlwvnkhccrqj9l`](https://cardanoscan.io/stakeKey/stake17xd74ehu0l4d5mx0sfz4fd0r5jvw4v2jqkkfyjxrlwvnkhccrqj9l)\n\n- [Pi Lanningham](https://github.com/Quantumplation) responsible for the **ad hoc work and middleware integrations** (a.k.a mercenaries) with a budget of 2.5 FTEs (**`\u20b3500,000`**) until end of 2025.\n\n  Managing treasury at: [`stake17xrh74lqhhxgzelfsn0wq5kcm4e5dmluprlcpg5mq30p5yqhgk7k8`](https://cardanoscan.io/stakeKey/stake17xrh74lqhhxgzelfsn0wq5kcm4e5dmluprlcpg5mq30p5yqhgk7k8)\n\n- [Damien Czapla](https://github.com/Dam-CZ) responsible for the **project management, public relations & marketing** with a budget of 0.5 FTE (**`\u20b3100,000`**) until end of 2025.\n\n  Managing treasury at: [`stake17xrqac8khkprtpp2jz90mpkujjwye8dt6a9sjewrvjudx9ggg4u5y`](https://cardanoscan.io/stakeKey/stake17xrqac8khkprtpp2jz90mpkujjwye8dt6a9sjewrvjudx9ggg4u5y)\n\n- [Santiago Carmuega](https://github.com/scarmuega) responsible for the **p2p networking**. Santiago oversees **no part of the treasury budget** whatsoever related to Amaru in 2025. The networking's funding has been fully secured through other mechanisms.\n\nAdditionally, Arnaud, Matthias, Pi and Damien are collectively responsible for the _contingency_ scope with a budget of **`\u20b3300,000`** until the end of 2025, corresponding to 25% of the sum of all other budgets as outlined in the [budget proposal](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafkreibqma7t2k4rcywvx5afukahhi3dp2so2ugh7t4ljuawhanvk7sr34).\n\nThe contingency treasury's stake address is: [`stake178jztxzwynajcp4dva5gy9udmmnwg7ueffvf4c7hpjqhc7gtj5nzz`](https://cardanoscan.io/stakeKey/stake178jztxzwynajcp4dva5gy9udmmnwg7ueffvf4c7hpjqhc7gtj5nzz)\n\n---\n\nIn total, we request **`\u20b31,500,000`** (1.5M ADA).\n\n---\n\n> **NOTES**\n>\n> 1. Efforts are estimated in FTE (Full-Time Employee) valued at $200K / \u20b3400K per annum.\n>\n> 2. As outlined in the initial budget proposal, the withdrawal requests only account for resources that aren't currently covered by other means (e.g. sponsorship, employee payroll, Catalyst, ...). In particular, every scope owner highlighted above is fully covered **outside** of this withdrawal.\n\n## Building an alternative node\n\n[Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) provides an alternative perspective and solution for both stake pool operators and developers, prioritizing a modular approach, a seamless user experience, and low hardware requirements. Additionally, the project is primarily implemented in Rust, which is well-suited for high assurance, thereby attracting new contributors to the core maintenance of the ecosystem.\n\nFor more details, please refer to the [budget proposal](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafybeicyqwjcg4x52l4ml5ocjlqnproqdjgfbguxdge4saxxvu2hidzvpq) which already covers in great length the project, its goals, its deliverables and its methodology\n\n## Why request funds from Cardano's treasury\n\n### Decentralized core infrastructure\n\nBlock-producing nodes (a.k.a. stake pools) and relays are at the heart of Cardano's infrastructure. Together, they constitute and support the Cardano network. [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) aims at offering an alternative piece to this core infrastructure, thus becoming part of this core infrastructure. We firmly believe that decentralizing the core infrastructure\u2014without disrupting its operational resilience\u2014is a necessary step toward a more robust and secure network.\n\nAdditionally, supporting the blockchain base layer should be a shared responsibility. Stakepool operators already share the burden of operating the network, and it is time to share the responsibility for its development and technical evolution. [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) makes a significant leap in sharing this responsibility, not only by incrementally delivering a capable block-producing node for the network but also by paving the way for those who come after through documentation, conformance tests and engineering specifications.\n\nBy its very nature, [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) is a project that aligns with Cardano's vision. As a core infrastructure component, it is also challenging and undesirable to articulate a business model around the project without compromising its essence. We believe that because of these reasons, [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) qualifies for treasury withdrawals.\n\n### Open source & neutrality\n\nThe project is, of course, open source. We have linked [the code repository](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) throughout this document and referred to it also in the original budget proposal. As outlined in the budget proposal, not only is the code public, but the project's progress, evolutions, and decisions are also publicly available. The team strives to remain accessible through public forums and regular touchpoints open to all.\n\nThe core team comprises individuals from various entities and backgrounds. And, while not obvious, this is a situation very dear to us. To preserve Amaru's neutrality and openness, we must ensure that core contributors are not tied to a single actor. Cardano's treasury offers a perfect solution to this problem as it virtually represents a source of funding that is _\"everyone and no one at the same time\"_.\n\nReceiving funding from the Cardano treasury makes the [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) team accountable towards the Cardano community. It turns the Cardano community into our ultimate stakeholder, which is both good and desirable for a project of this nature.",

          "title": "Amaru Treasury Withdrawal 2025",
          "abstract": "[Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) is an open-source project implementing a new fully interoperable block-producing node for Cardano. It aims to improve the network's overall accessibility and robustness without compromising its safety and security.\n\nThis treasury withdrawal of \u20b31.5M follows a previously submitted and now approved [budget proposal](https://explorer.cardano.org/tx/bd488931f792651fefa9c6fda185a2c6cec83245b51d994e33090ce36e29cc26). It is split across five script addresses each covering a scope of a work (ledger, consensus, mercenaries and marketing) and a contingency reserve.",
          "rationale": "## Administration of the budget\n\nThe [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) maintainer committee ensures **direct administration** of its budget, assisted by an **on-chain smart contract**. Off-chain, the fund management, responsibilities and remuneration of contributors follow [PRAGMA's Maintainer Committee Framework](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafkreiabxyva5lfm6zztg7tnktxvvbbucljrce7hlrp4p6hropqzfaip3y). Additionally, the smart contract's role is to ensure that funds are expended under the scope of work defined in this budget and authorized by the relevant scope owners.\n\nOur [final solution](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru-treasury) is built as an extension of the treasury management contract [presented by Sundae Labs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDSoc4sNxbM) in the context of a mission for Intersect. Our additions enable, most importantly, the dynamic definition of scope owners and their adjustment if necessary (e.g., key loss, departure, death) upon approval by the PRAGMA general assembly (requiring 5 signatures out of 5 members).\n\nWhile already [extensively](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru-treasury/blob/main/validators/permissions.test.ak) [tested](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru-treasury/blob/main/validators/traps.test.ak), our final solution is still being audited at the moment of writing this proposal. We do not wish to rush the auditors or take any risk regarding treasury management. \n\nHowever, due to time constraints stemming from the need to continue paying contributors whose payroll expires in the upcoming weeks, we have decided to proceed with a simplified setup and migrate to our final setup once it is ready.\n\nThe simplified setup relies entirely on the [initial solution designed and developed by Sundae Labs](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/), which has been extensively tested and fully audited by two independent parties (attached as external references to this proposal). We have also audited, tested and experimented with this solution on our own.\n\n### Initial setup\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pragma-org/amaru-treasury/fdf1981246cac9802c95191aec68a63567b73eed/.github/img/treasury-simplified-overview-dark.jpg)\n\nWe define 5 Amaru treasuries: one for each scope of work and one for the contingency budget. \n\nThe same smart contract governs each treasury, although it is configured differently in each case. It ensures funds coming from either UTxOs or reward accounts move according to specific operations with a precise semantic:\n\n- **reorganize**: allows for the collection and combination of multiple sources (e.g., multiple UTxOs) into another distribution with at least as many assets. This action is typically used to consolidate multiple UTxOs into a single one for easier treasury management.\n\n- **sweep**: after an agreed-upon expiration date, allows sending all ada leftovers (unconsumed budgets) back to the Cardano's treasury. Any native asset (e.g. USDM) is kept within the contract. The action can also be triggered at an earlier stage through a specific authorization.\n\n- **disburse**: allow payment of funds (ada or native assets) into an arbitrary address, up until the budget's expiration date. Only native assets can be disbursed beyond the expiration date to allow converting them back to ada.\n\n- **fund**: disburse funds into another set of on-chain validators ('vendors') pre-configured with a payment schedule. **We will not make use of this operation. It is fully disabled in our setup**. Disbursement will only happen through the _disburse_ action.\n\nIn addition to rules specified as part of the smart contract, each operation also defines a set of permissions. Permissions can take the form of a multisig or another script. \n\nIn the initial setup, we configure **each treasury** with permissions as follows:\n\n- The **reorganize** operation can be fully authorized by the respective scope owner alone. In the case of the _contingency_ budget, any scope owner is capable of authorizing a 'reorganize' operation. \n\n- The **sweep** operation requires 3 out of 4 authorizations until the end of 2025. It can be performed by *any ada holder* after that date.\n\n- **disburse** operation requires 3 out of 4 authorizations until the end of 2025. Disbursement of ada is forbidden after that date.  \n\n- The **fund** operation is entirely disabled using a permission setting that is impossible to satisfy.\n\n\n### Final setup\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pragma-org/amaru-treasury/8a6782c277e5ae6cc2ea446711bc33b6b56892ce/.github/img/treasury-overview-dark.jpg)\n\nIn a second phase, once the external audit has been finalized and our confidence in the contract is sufficient, we'll move towards our final vision for the 2025 budget management. This second solution is still smart-contract-based and builds upon the initial solution. \n\nIt is motivated by the desire to allow rotating credentials associated with scope owners to cope with two main issues:\n\n1. the loss of key from a scope owner;\n2. the departure of a scope owner from the project.\n\nRelying on a rigid setup which statically defines the scope owners is risky and unpractical. So instead, we recognize the following additional capabilities to the final solution:\n\n- **Credential rotation**: In case of loss of credentials or departure of a scope owner, a mechanism allows rotating credentials to new scope owners upon approval by all (5 out of 5) PRAGMA members.\n\n## Financial audit\n\nThe _'ad-hoc'_ scope of work makes provision for a financial auditor who will be picked at a later stage. \n\nTo facilitate the work of the auditor, we will attach metadata with key `1694` to transactions spending from the smart contracts, in accordance with [CIP-100](https://cips.cardano.org/cip/CIP-0100).\n\nInitial metadata describing each _Initial Setup(s)_ have already been published and are visible on-chain.\n\n| Scope / Budget | Transaction Id |\n| ---          | ---            | \n| Ledger       | [`cd25ce7b027fea4e28d5075691aa5822baa859bc74cc79db0377043bc9f383c7`](explorer.cardano.org/preview/tx/cd25ce7b027fea4e28d5075691aa5822baa859bc74cc79db0377043bc9f383c7) | \n| Consensus    | [`e5be93f2530c51e0b1582e5a0e99ccb1235e4395a41c7196d06c4daea3eafe66`](explorer.cardano.org/preview/tx/e5be93f2530c51e0b1582e5a0e99ccb1235e4395a41c7196d06c4daea3eafe66) |\n| Mercenaries  | [`0729a234e4e12b945f06189ca479681e49ffcc116fb3713720bada72180fe27c`](explorer.cardano.org/preview/tx/0729a234e4e12b945f06189ca479681e49ffcc116fb3713720bada72180fe27c) | \n| Marketing    | [`5697f433442317f04f539baecdf71fee01b3e8453c658a4d782648bc1e4f4490`](explorer.cardano.org/preview/tx/5697f433442317f04f539baecdf71fee01b3e8453c658a4d782648bc1e4f4490) | \n| Contingency  | [`44ae2c263b2115023e4b137f718549fcac78c0a59b7983e918d9e79d1a503b3c`](explorer.cardano.org/preview/tx/44ae2c263b2115023e4b137f718549fcac78c0a59b7983e918d9e79d1a503b3c) | \n\nTo further ease this process for the least technologically inclined, we will also collect in [a publicly available journal](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru-treasury/tree/main/journal#journal) an audit log of these transactions and a human-readable version of their metadata. \n\n## Constitutionality self-assessment\n\nBeing one of the first proposals of this nature ever submitted, it is easy to get things wrong. To convince ourselves of its constitutionality, we thought it relevant to include a checklist of the points we cover and, for each, our interpretation of the Cardano Constitution. \n\n#### Purpose\n\n- [x] This proposal is for work intended to enhance the security, decentralization and long-term sustainability of Cardano.\n\n#### Article III.5: on-chain governance process\n\n- [x] We have submitted this proposal in a standardized, legible format, which includes a URL and hash of all documented off-chain content. We believe our rationale to be detailed and sufficient. The proposal includes a title, abstract, rationale for the proposal, and relevant supporting materials.\n\n#### Article IV.1: budgets\n\n- [x] This proposal gives effect to the [previously presented and agreed upon budget](https://explorer.cardano.org/tx/9b62b3c632f329016a968ac25211825bb4f84b12461121c7da3aa11df92370f9), as indicated in this provision. \n\n#### Article IV.2: funds administration\n\n- [x] This proposal specifies an administrator in accordance with this provision. It also specifies an internal administration process using smart contracts and an off-chain overseeing committee, meeting the requirements of this clause, which requires a process that may include an administrator.\n\n#### Article IV.3: net-change limit\n\n- [x] Being of \u20b31.5M and taking place mid-2025, this withdrawal request does not violate the [currently agreed upon Net-Change Limit](https://explorer.cardano.org/tx/9b62b3c632f329016a968ac25211825bb4f84b12461121c7da3aa11df92370f9).\n\n#### Article IV.4: auditor & contractual obligations\n\n- [x] This proposal makes provisions for a financial auditor (covered by the _'ad-hoc'_ scope). The auditor will be picked at a later stage, and their work will be facilitated through the publication of metadata alongside any movement of funds out of the smart contracts.\n\n- [x] Our off-chain legal framework knwon as [PRAGMA's Maintainer Committee Framework](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafkreiabxyva5lfm6zztg7tnktxvvbbucljrce7hlrp4p6hropqzfaip3y) makes provision for a dispute resolution for contractors receiving an allocation in the context of this treasury withdrawal. It explicitly states that _\"Any dispute arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts of Zurich\"_. \n\n#### Article IV.5: vesting rules\n\n- [x] The use of intermediary smart contracts is used prior to any disbursement of funds to beneficiaries. In particular, we intend to attach on-chain metadata to facilitate financial audits.\n\n- [x] Our on-chain smart contract solution simultaneously enforces that:\n  1. funds (at the contract) cannot be delegated to an SPO; and\n  2. funds (at the contract) shall be delegated to an auto-abstain DRep.\n  \n  Note that we cannot prevent others from creating undelegated UTxOs at the contract's address. Yet, the contract stipulates that the outputs of each operation (e.g., reorganize) carry delegation rights in accordance with this provision.\n\n#### Guardrails\n\n- [x] TREASURY-01a - There's is currently an [approved Net-Change limit](https://explorer.cardano.org/tx/9b62b3c632f329016a968ac25211825bb4f84b12461121c7da3aa11df92370f9) of \u20b3350,000,000 finishing at the conclusion of Epoch 604 in December 2025.\n\n- [x] TREASURY-02a - At the moment of proposing this, there hasn't been any enacted treasury withdrawal for the current period covered by the Net-Change limit. Being of \u20b31.5M, this withdrawal is, at the moment of proposing it, within the Net-Change Limit. \n\n- [x] TREASURY-03a - This withdrawal is denominated in ada.\n\n- [x] TREASURY-04a - This withdrawal follows a [budget proposal](https://explorer.cardano.org/tx/bd488931f792651fefa9c6fda185a2c6cec83245b51d994e33090ce36e29cc26) that the DReps have agreed on with a threshold of greater than 50% of the active voting stake.\n\n## Notations & definitions\n\n- We denote 'ADA' as `\u20b3` throughout this proposal. We may use either notation interchangeably. \n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) project represents a major step towards node diversity through the development of a modular, high-performance, and interoperable block-producing node for Cardano. Our approach, rooted in openness, innovation, and operational resilience, aims to deliver significant advancements in blockchain technology without compromising on security.\n\nThis withdrawal aims to clearly outline a transparent budget management process, leveraging the capabilities of our chain to enforce this process as reasonably possible in the given timeframe. \n\nBeing an ongoing project, [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) comes with its own set of constraints. Yet, we try our best to pioneer what we think could be one of Cardano's most pivotal moments.",
          "motivation": "## Who we are\n\n[Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) is a multi-entity effort that currently sits under [PRAGMA](https://pragma.io): a member-based, not-for-profit association for open-source blockchain software projects. Five members with equal power currently drive PRAGMA's strategy and operations: Blink Labs, Cardano Foundation, dcSpark, Sundae Labs, and TxPipe. Each of them has a proven track record of building on Cardano and supporting our ecosystem.\n\n[Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru/graphs/contributors) itself is managed by an appointed maintainer committee in charge of different scopes. Each member of the maintainer committee is responsible for a scope of work and has oversight of its delivery, which includes managing the associated budget. The current maintainer committee comprises of:\n\n- [Matthias Benkort](https://github.com/ktorz) responsible for the **ledger & overall architecture** with a budget of 1.5 FTEs (**`\u20b3300,000`**) until end of 2025.\n\n  Managing treasury at: [`stake17xnev6rc25xwz8kg4qae8lq6dcg964z00py5gqgxd387pncv8fq8g`](https://cardanoscan.io/stakeKey/stake17xnev6rc25xwz8kg4qae8lq6dcg964z00py5gqgxd387pncv8fq8g)\n\n- [Arnaud Bailly](https://github.com/abailly) responsible for the **consensus and simulation testing**, with a budget of 1.5 FTEs (**`\u20b3300,000`**) until end of 2025.\n  \n  Managing treasury at: [`stake17xd74ehu0l4d5mx0sfz4fd0r5jvw4v2jqkkfyjxrlwvnkhccrqj9l`](https://cardanoscan.io/stakeKey/stake17xd74ehu0l4d5mx0sfz4fd0r5jvw4v2jqkkfyjxrlwvnkhccrqj9l)\n\n- [Pi Lanningham](https://github.com/Quantumplation) responsible for the **ad hoc work and middleware integrations** (a.k.a mercenaries) with a budget of 2.5 FTEs (**`\u20b3500,000`**) until end of 2025.\n\n  Managing treasury at: [`stake17xrh74lqhhxgzelfsn0wq5kcm4e5dmluprlcpg5mq30p5yqhgk7k8`](https://cardanoscan.io/stakeKey/stake17xrh74lqhhxgzelfsn0wq5kcm4e5dmluprlcpg5mq30p5yqhgk7k8)\n\n- [Damien Czapla](https://github.com/Dam-CZ) responsible for the **project management, public relations & marketing** with a budget of 0.5 FTE (**`\u20b3100,000`**) until end of 2025.\n\n  Managing treasury at: [`stake17xrqac8khkprtpp2jz90mpkujjwye8dt6a9sjewrvjudx9ggg4u5y`](https://cardanoscan.io/stakeKey/stake17xrqac8khkprtpp2jz90mpkujjwye8dt6a9sjewrvjudx9ggg4u5y)\n\n- [Santiago Carmuega](https://github.com/scarmuega) responsible for the **p2p networking**. Santiago oversees **no part of the treasury budget** whatsoever related to Amaru in 2025. The networking's funding has been fully secured through other mechanisms.\n\nAdditionally, Arnaud, Matthias, Pi and Damien are collectively responsible for the _contingency_ scope with a budget of **`\u20b3300,000`** until the end of 2025, corresponding to 25% of the sum of all other budgets as outlined in the [budget proposal](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafkreibqma7t2k4rcywvx5afukahhi3dp2so2ugh7t4ljuawhanvk7sr34).\n\nThe contingency treasury's stake address is: [`stake178jztxzwynajcp4dva5gy9udmmnwg7ueffvf4c7hpjqhc7gtj5nzz`](https://cardanoscan.io/stakeKey/stake178jztxzwynajcp4dva5gy9udmmnwg7ueffvf4c7hpjqhc7gtj5nzz)\n\n---\n\nIn total, we request **`\u20b31,500,000`** (1.5M ADA).\n\n---\n\n> **NOTES**\n>\n> 1. Efforts are estimated in FTE (Full-Time Employee) valued at $200K / \u20b3400K per annum.\n>\n> 2. As outlined in the initial budget proposal, the withdrawal requests only account for resources that aren't currently covered by other means (e.g. sponsorship, employee payroll, Catalyst, ...). In particular, every scope owner highlighted above is fully covered **outside** of this withdrawal.\n\n## Building an alternative node\n\n[Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) provides an alternative perspective and solution for both stake pool operators and developers, prioritizing a modular approach, a seamless user experience, and low hardware requirements. Additionally, the project is primarily implemented in Rust, which is well-suited for high assurance, thereby attracting new contributors to the core maintenance of the ecosystem.\n\nFor more details, please refer to the [budget proposal](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafybeicyqwjcg4x52l4ml5ocjlqnproqdjgfbguxdge4saxxvu2hidzvpq) which already covers in great length the project, its goals, its deliverables and its methodology\n\n## Why request funds from Cardano's treasury\n\n### Decentralized core infrastructure\n\nBlock-producing nodes (a.k.a. stake pools) and relays are at the heart of Cardano's infrastructure. Together, they constitute and support the Cardano network. [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) aims at offering an alternative piece to this core infrastructure, thus becoming part of this core infrastructure. We firmly believe that decentralizing the core infrastructure\u2014without disrupting its operational resilience\u2014is a necessary step toward a more robust and secure network.\n\nAdditionally, supporting the blockchain base layer should be a shared responsibility. Stakepool operators already share the burden of operating the network, and it is time to share the responsibility for its development and technical evolution. [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) makes a significant leap in sharing this responsibility, not only by incrementally delivering a capable block-producing node for the network but also by paving the way for those who come after through documentation, conformance tests and engineering specifications.\n\nBy its very nature, [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) is a project that aligns with Cardano's vision. As a core infrastructure component, it is also challenging and undesirable to articulate a business model around the project without compromising its essence. We believe that because of these reasons, [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) qualifies for treasury withdrawals.\n\n### Open source & neutrality\n\nThe project is, of course, open source. We have linked [the code repository](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) throughout this document and referred to it also in the original budget proposal. As outlined in the budget proposal, not only is the code public, but the project's progress, evolutions, and decisions are also publicly available. The team strives to remain accessible through public forums and regular touchpoints open to all.\n\nThe core team comprises individuals from various entities and backgrounds. And, while not obvious, this is a situation very dear to us. To preserve Amaru's neutrality and openness, we must ensure that core contributors are not tied to a single actor. Cardano's treasury offers a perfect solution to this problem as it virtually represents a source of funding that is _\"everyone and no one at the same time\"_.\n\nReceiving funding from the Cardano treasury makes the [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) team accountable towards the Cardano community. It turns the Cardano community into our ultimate stakeholder, which is both good and desirable for a project of this nature.",

          "title": "Amaru Treasury Withdrawal 2025",
          "abstract": "[Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) is an open-source project implementing a new fully interoperable block-producing node for Cardano. It aims to improve the network's overall accessibility and robustness without compromising its safety and security.\n\nThis treasury withdrawal of \u20b31.5M follows a previously submitted and now approved [budget proposal](https://explorer.cardano.org/tx/bd488931f792651fefa9c6fda185a2c6cec83245b51d994e33090ce36e29cc26). It is split across five script addresses each covering a scope of a work (ledger, consensus, mercenaries and marketing) and a contingency reserve.",
          "rationale": "## Administration of the budget\n\nThe [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) maintainer committee ensures **direct administration** of its budget, assisted by an **on-chain smart contract**. Off-chain, the fund management, responsibilities and remuneration of contributors follow [PRAGMA's Maintainer Committee Framework](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafkreiabxyva5lfm6zztg7tnktxvvbbucljrce7hlrp4p6hropqzfaip3y). Additionally, the smart contract's role is to ensure that funds are expended under the scope of work defined in this budget and authorized by the relevant scope owners.\n\nOur [final solution](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru-treasury) is built as an extension of the treasury management contract [presented by Sundae Labs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDSoc4sNxbM) in the context of a mission for Intersect. Our additions enable, most importantly, the dynamic definition of scope owners and their adjustment if necessary (e.g., key loss, departure, death) upon approval by the PRAGMA general assembly (requiring 5 signatures out of 5 members).\n\nWhile already [extensively](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru-treasury/blob/main/validators/permissions.test.ak) [tested](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru-treasury/blob/main/validators/traps.test.ak), our final solution is still being audited at the moment of writing this proposal. We do not wish to rush the auditors or take any risk regarding treasury management. \n\nHowever, due to time constraints stemming from the need to continue paying contributors whose payroll expires in the upcoming weeks, we have decided to proceed with a simplified setup and migrate to our final setup once it is ready.\n\nThe simplified setup relies entirely on the [initial solution designed and developed by Sundae Labs](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/), which has been extensively tested and fully audited by two independent parties (attached as external references to this proposal). We have also audited, tested and experimented with this solution on our own.\n\n### Initial setup\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pragma-org/amaru-treasury/fdf1981246cac9802c95191aec68a63567b73eed/.github/img/treasury-simplified-overview-dark.jpg)\n\nWe define 5 Amaru treasuries: one for each scope of work and one for the contingency budget. \n\nThe same smart contract governs each treasury, although it is configured differently in each case. It ensures funds coming from either UTxOs or reward accounts move according to specific operations with a precise semantic:\n\n- **reorganize**: allows for the collection and combination of multiple sources (e.g., multiple UTxOs) into another distribution with at least as many assets. This action is typically used to consolidate multiple UTxOs into a single one for easier treasury management.\n\n- **sweep**: after an agreed-upon expiration date, allows sending all ada leftovers (unconsumed budgets) back to the Cardano's treasury. Any native asset (e.g. USDM) is kept within the contract. The action can also be triggered at an earlier stage through a specific authorization.\n\n- **disburse**: allow payment of funds (ada or native assets) into an arbitrary address, up until the budget's expiration date. Only native assets can be disbursed beyond the expiration date to allow converting them back to ada.\n\n- **fund**: disburse funds into another set of on-chain validators ('vendors') pre-configured with a payment schedule. **We will not make use of this operation. It is fully disabled in our setup**. Disbursement will only happen through the _disburse_ action.\n\nIn addition to rules specified as part of the smart contract, each operation also defines a set of permissions. Permissions can take the form of a multisig or another script. \n\nIn the initial setup, we configure **each treasury** with permissions as follows:\n\n- The **reorganize** operation can be fully authorized by the respective scope owner alone. In the case of the _contingency_ budget, any scope owner is capable of authorizing a 'reorganize' operation. \n\n- The **sweep** operation requires 3 out of 4 authorizations until the end of 2025. It can be performed by *any ada holder* after that date.\n\n- **disburse** operation requires 3 out of 4 authorizations until the end of 2025. Disbursement of ada is forbidden after that date.  \n\n- The **fund** operation is entirely disabled using a permission setting that is impossible to satisfy.\n\n\n### Final setup\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pragma-org/amaru-treasury/8a6782c277e5ae6cc2ea446711bc33b6b56892ce/.github/img/treasury-overview-dark.jpg)\n\nIn a second phase, once the external audit has been finalized and our confidence in the contract is sufficient, we'll move towards our final vision for the 2025 budget management. This second solution is still smart-contract-based and builds upon the initial solution. \n\nIt is motivated by the desire to allow rotating credentials associated with scope owners to cope with two main issues:\n\n1. the loss of key from a scope owner;\n2. the departure of a scope owner from the project.\n\nRelying on a rigid setup which statically defines the scope owners is risky and unpractical. So instead, we recognize the following additional capabilities to the final solution:\n\n- **Credential rotation**: In case of loss of credentials or departure of a scope owner, a mechanism allows rotating credentials to new scope owners upon approval by all (5 out of 5) PRAGMA members.\n\n## Financial audit\n\nThe _'ad-hoc'_ scope of work makes provision for a financial auditor who will be picked at a later stage. \n\nTo facilitate the work of the auditor, we will attach metadata with key `1694` to transactions spending from the smart contracts, in accordance with [CIP-100](https://cips.cardano.org/cip/CIP-0100).\n\nInitial metadata describing each _Initial Setup(s)_ have already been published and are visible on-chain.\n\n| Scope / Budget | Transaction Id |\n| ---          | ---            | \n| Ledger       | [`cd25ce7b027fea4e28d5075691aa5822baa859bc74cc79db0377043bc9f383c7`](explorer.cardano.org/preview/tx/cd25ce7b027fea4e28d5075691aa5822baa859bc74cc79db0377043bc9f383c7) | \n| Consensus    | [`e5be93f2530c51e0b1582e5a0e99ccb1235e4395a41c7196d06c4daea3eafe66`](explorer.cardano.org/preview/tx/e5be93f2530c51e0b1582e5a0e99ccb1235e4395a41c7196d06c4daea3eafe66) |\n| Mercenaries  | [`0729a234e4e12b945f06189ca479681e49ffcc116fb3713720bada72180fe27c`](explorer.cardano.org/preview/tx/0729a234e4e12b945f06189ca479681e49ffcc116fb3713720bada72180fe27c) | \n| Marketing    | [`5697f433442317f04f539baecdf71fee01b3e8453c658a4d782648bc1e4f4490`](explorer.cardano.org/preview/tx/5697f433442317f04f539baecdf71fee01b3e8453c658a4d782648bc1e4f4490) | \n| Contingency  | [`44ae2c263b2115023e4b137f718549fcac78c0a59b7983e918d9e79d1a503b3c`](explorer.cardano.org/preview/tx/44ae2c263b2115023e4b137f718549fcac78c0a59b7983e918d9e79d1a503b3c) | \n\nTo further ease this process for the least technologically inclined, we will also collect in [a publicly available journal](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru-treasury/tree/main/journal#journal) an audit log of these transactions and a human-readable version of their metadata. \n\n## Constitutionality self-assessment\n\nBeing one of the first proposals of this nature ever submitted, it is easy to get things wrong. To convince ourselves of its constitutionality, we thought it relevant to include a checklist of the points we cover and, for each, our interpretation of the Cardano Constitution. \n\n#### Purpose\n\n- [x] This proposal is for work intended to enhance the security, decentralization and long-term sustainability of Cardano.\n\n#### Article III.5: on-chain governance process\n\n- [x] We have submitted this proposal in a standardized, legible format, which includes a URL and hash of all documented off-chain content. We believe our rationale to be detailed and sufficient. The proposal includes a title, abstract, rationale for the proposal, and relevant supporting materials.\n\n#### Article IV.1: budgets\n\n- [x] This proposal gives effect to the [previously presented and agreed upon budget](https://explorer.cardano.org/tx/9b62b3c632f329016a968ac25211825bb4f84b12461121c7da3aa11df92370f9), as indicated in this provision. \n\n#### Article IV.2: funds administration\n\n- [x] This proposal specifies an administrator in accordance with this provision. It also specifies an internal administration process using smart contracts and an off-chain overseeing committee, meeting the requirements of this clause, which requires a process that may include an administrator.\n\n#### Article IV.3: net-change limit\n\n- [x] Being of \u20b31.5M and taking place mid-2025, this withdrawal request does not violate the [currently agreed upon Net-Change Limit](https://explorer.cardano.org/tx/9b62b3c632f329016a968ac25211825bb4f84b12461121c7da3aa11df92370f9).\n\n#### Article IV.4: auditor & contractual obligations\n\n- [x] This proposal makes provisions for a financial auditor (covered by the _'ad-hoc'_ scope). The auditor will be picked at a later stage, and their work will be facilitated through the publication of metadata alongside any movement of funds out of the smart contracts.\n\n- [x] Our off-chain legal framework knwon as [PRAGMA's Maintainer Committee Framework](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafkreiabxyva5lfm6zztg7tnktxvvbbucljrce7hlrp4p6hropqzfaip3y) makes provision for a dispute resolution for contractors receiving an allocation in the context of this treasury withdrawal. It explicitly states that _\"Any dispute arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts of Zurich\"_. \n\n#### Article IV.5: vesting rules\n\n- [x] The use of intermediary smart contracts is used prior to any disbursement of funds to beneficiaries. In particular, we intend to attach on-chain metadata to facilitate financial audits.\n\n- [x] Our on-chain smart contract solution simultaneously enforces that:\n  1. funds (at the contract) cannot be delegated to an SPO; and\n  2. funds (at the contract) shall be delegated to an auto-abstain DRep.\n  \n  Note that we cannot prevent others from creating undelegated UTxOs at the contract's address. Yet, the contract stipulates that the outputs of each operation (e.g., reorganize) carry delegation rights in accordance with this provision.\n\n#### Guardrails\n\n- [x] TREASURY-01a - There's is currently an [approved Net-Change limit](https://explorer.cardano.org/tx/9b62b3c632f329016a968ac25211825bb4f84b12461121c7da3aa11df92370f9) of \u20b3350,000,000 finishing at the conclusion of Epoch 604 in December 2025.\n\n- [x] TREASURY-02a - At the moment of proposing this, there hasn't been any enacted treasury withdrawal for the current period covered by the Net-Change limit. Being of \u20b31.5M, this withdrawal is, at the moment of proposing it, within the Net-Change Limit. \n\n- [x] TREASURY-03a - This withdrawal is denominated in ada.\n\n- [x] TREASURY-04a - This withdrawal follows a [budget proposal](https://explorer.cardano.org/tx/bd488931f792651fefa9c6fda185a2c6cec83245b51d994e33090ce36e29cc26) that the DReps have agreed on with a threshold of greater than 50% of the active voting stake.\n\n## Notations & definitions\n\n- We denote 'ADA' as `\u20b3` throughout this proposal. We may use either notation interchangeably. \n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) project represents a major step towards node diversity through the development of a modular, high-performance, and interoperable block-producing node for Cardano. Our approach, rooted in openness, innovation, and operational resilience, aims to deliver significant advancements in blockchain technology without compromising on security.\n\nThis withdrawal aims to clearly outline a transparent budget management process, leveraging the capabilities of our chain to enforce this process as reasonably possible in the given timeframe. \n\nBeing an ongoing project, [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) comes with its own set of constraints. Yet, we try our best to pioneer what we think could be one of Cardano's most pivotal moments.",
          "motivation": "## Who we are\n\n[Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) is a multi-entity effort that currently sits under [PRAGMA](https://pragma.io): a member-based, not-for-profit association for open-source blockchain software projects. Five members with equal power currently drive PRAGMA's strategy and operations: Blink Labs, Cardano Foundation, dcSpark, Sundae Labs, and TxPipe. Each of them has a proven track record of building on Cardano and supporting our ecosystem.\n\n[Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru/graphs/contributors) itself is managed by an appointed maintainer committee in charge of different scopes. Each member of the maintainer committee is responsible for a scope of work and has oversight of its delivery, which includes managing the associated budget. The current maintainer committee comprises of:\n\n- [Matthias Benkort](https://github.com/ktorz) responsible for the **ledger & overall architecture** with a budget of 1.5 FTEs (**`\u20b3300,000`**) until end of 2025.\n\n  Managing treasury at: [`stake17xnev6rc25xwz8kg4qae8lq6dcg964z00py5gqgxd387pncv8fq8g`](https://cardanoscan.io/stakeKey/stake17xnev6rc25xwz8kg4qae8lq6dcg964z00py5gqgxd387pncv8fq8g)\n\n- [Arnaud Bailly](https://github.com/abailly) responsible for the **consensus and simulation testing**, with a budget of 1.5 FTEs (**`\u20b3300,000`**) until end of 2025.\n  \n  Managing treasury at: [`stake17xd74ehu0l4d5mx0sfz4fd0r5jvw4v2jqkkfyjxrlwvnkhccrqj9l`](https://cardanoscan.io/stakeKey/stake17xd74ehu0l4d5mx0sfz4fd0r5jvw4v2jqkkfyjxrlwvnkhccrqj9l)\n\n- [Pi Lanningham](https://github.com/Quantumplation) responsible for the **ad hoc work and middleware integrations** (a.k.a mercenaries) with a budget of 2.5 FTEs (**`\u20b3500,000`**) until end of 2025.\n\n  Managing treasury at: [`stake17xrh74lqhhxgzelfsn0wq5kcm4e5dmluprlcpg5mq30p5yqhgk7k8`](https://cardanoscan.io/stakeKey/stake17xrh74lqhhxgzelfsn0wq5kcm4e5dmluprlcpg5mq30p5yqhgk7k8)\n\n- [Damien Czapla](https://github.com/Dam-CZ) responsible for the **project management, public relations & marketing** with a budget of 0.5 FTE (**`\u20b3100,000`**) until end of 2025.\n\n  Managing treasury at: [`stake17xrqac8khkprtpp2jz90mpkujjwye8dt6a9sjewrvjudx9ggg4u5y`](https://cardanoscan.io/stakeKey/stake17xrqac8khkprtpp2jz90mpkujjwye8dt6a9sjewrvjudx9ggg4u5y)\n\n- [Santiago Carmuega](https://github.com/scarmuega) responsible for the **p2p networking**. Santiago oversees **no part of the treasury budget** whatsoever related to Amaru in 2025. The networking's funding has been fully secured through other mechanisms.\n\nAdditionally, Arnaud, Matthias, Pi and Damien are collectively responsible for the _contingency_ scope with a budget of **`\u20b3300,000`** until the end of 2025, corresponding to 25% of the sum of all other budgets as outlined in the [budget proposal](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafkreibqma7t2k4rcywvx5afukahhi3dp2so2ugh7t4ljuawhanvk7sr34).\n\nThe contingency treasury's stake address is: [`stake178jztxzwynajcp4dva5gy9udmmnwg7ueffvf4c7hpjqhc7gtj5nzz`](https://cardanoscan.io/stakeKey/stake178jztxzwynajcp4dva5gy9udmmnwg7ueffvf4c7hpjqhc7gtj5nzz)\n\n---\n\nIn total, we request **`\u20b31,500,000`** (1.5M ADA).\n\n---\n\n> **NOTES**\n>\n> 1. Efforts are estimated in FTE (Full-Time Employee) valued at $200K / \u20b3400K per annum.\n>\n> 2. As outlined in the initial budget proposal, the withdrawal requests only account for resources that aren't currently covered by other means (e.g. sponsorship, employee payroll, Catalyst, ...). In particular, every scope owner highlighted above is fully covered **outside** of this withdrawal.\n\n## Building an alternative node\n\n[Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) provides an alternative perspective and solution for both stake pool operators and developers, prioritizing a modular approach, a seamless user experience, and low hardware requirements. Additionally, the project is primarily implemented in Rust, which is well-suited for high assurance, thereby attracting new contributors to the core maintenance of the ecosystem.\n\nFor more details, please refer to the [budget proposal](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafybeicyqwjcg4x52l4ml5ocjlqnproqdjgfbguxdge4saxxvu2hidzvpq) which already covers in great length the project, its goals, its deliverables and its methodology\n\n## Why request funds from Cardano's treasury\n\n### Decentralized core infrastructure\n\nBlock-producing nodes (a.k.a. stake pools) and relays are at the heart of Cardano's infrastructure. Together, they constitute and support the Cardano network. [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) aims at offering an alternative piece to this core infrastructure, thus becoming part of this core infrastructure. We firmly believe that decentralizing the core infrastructure\u2014without disrupting its operational resilience\u2014is a necessary step toward a more robust and secure network.\n\nAdditionally, supporting the blockchain base layer should be a shared responsibility. Stakepool operators already share the burden of operating the network, and it is time to share the responsibility for its development and technical evolution. [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) makes a significant leap in sharing this responsibility, not only by incrementally delivering a capable block-producing node for the network but also by paving the way for those who come after through documentation, conformance tests and engineering specifications.\n\nBy its very nature, [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) is a project that aligns with Cardano's vision. As a core infrastructure component, it is also challenging and undesirable to articulate a business model around the project without compromising its essence. We believe that because of these reasons, [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) qualifies for treasury withdrawals.\n\n### Open source & neutrality\n\nThe project is, of course, open source. We have linked [the code repository](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) throughout this document and referred to it also in the original budget proposal. As outlined in the budget proposal, not only is the code public, but the project's progress, evolutions, and decisions are also publicly available. The team strives to remain accessible through public forums and regular touchpoints open to all.\n\nThe core team comprises individuals from various entities and backgrounds. And, while not obvious, this is a situation very dear to us. To preserve Amaru's neutrality and openness, we must ensure that core contributors are not tied to a single actor. Cardano's treasury offers a perfect solution to this problem as it virtually represents a source of funding that is _\"everyone and no one at the same time\"_.\n\nReceiving funding from the Cardano treasury makes the [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) team accountable towards the Cardano community. It turns the Cardano community into our ultimate stakeholder, which is both good and desirable for a project of this nature.",

          "title": "Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget - 275M ada Administered by Intersect",
          "abstract": "On behalf of Intersect and the Cardano Budget Committee, this Budget Info Action proposes a Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget of 275,269,340 ada. The period during which this Budget Info Action remains in effect will begin at the close of its voting period and continue for 73 epochs (52 weeks). This budget is an aggregate allocation and following Treasury Withdrawal(s) must be in compliance with an approved and active Net Change Limit, among other conditions. This budget comprises 39 proposals that support maintenance, development, marketing, innovation, and governance initiatives within the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem.\n\nTo arrive at this budget, Intersect facilitated a community budget submission process, using live DRep stake to assess and validate support through the Ekklesia platform. More than 3.8B ada in voting stake participated, representing over 70% of actively delegated stake (excluding pre-defined voting options). A total of 194 proposals were submitted as part of Intersect\u2019s coordination efforts for budget socialization. Projects that received over 50% support by stake from participating DReps, and named Intersect as their Administrator, have been included in this Budget Info Action. Of the 194 proposals submitted, 40 met the required support threshold, and 39 of these named Intersect as their Administrator. Any proposals that proceeded directly on-chain outside of this Budget Info Action have been excluded from ours.\n\nAll proposals listed below have requested Intersect as their Administrator, who will oversee and administer the use of funds from Cardano Blockchain Treasury withdrawals in accordance with this budget and the requirements of the Cardano Constitution. This includes leveraging blockchain technology such as smart contracts as per Article IV, Section 2 in the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Constitution. Intersect, in our role as an Administrator for the included proposals in this aggregate budget, will - wherever possible and available - utilize a smart contract framework to oversee disbursements including a multi-signature oversight body made up of organizations and auditors, one of which will be Intersect in our role as Administrator.",
          "rationale": "This rationale underpins the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget Info Action - an aggregate allocation of 275,269,340 ada across 39 proposals that each won >50% of participating DRep stake (3.8B ada in live stake >70% of actively delegated stake excluding pre-defined voting options).\n\n**Proposal Intake & Consolidation**\n\nBetween 1 April  \u2013 5 May 2025, the Cardano Budget Committee at Intersect accepted funding requests through two streams:\n\n- Committee \u201cblock budgets\u201d connected to several Intersect committees (product, open source, governance, marketing, research) aligned to the vision and product roadmap.\n- Open community submissions from any Cardano contributor, regardless of Intersect membership.\n\nAll 194 submissions followed a standard template (problem, benefits, roadmap alignment, cost) and could be refined with committee feedback, capturing both top-down strategy and bottom-up innovation before DRep review.\n\n**Community Signalling**\n\nDReps and ada holders expressed their preferences in two rounds of off-chain polling: an initial GovTool survey and a final Ekklesia \u201ctemperature-check\u201d poll that closed at 23:59 UTC on 5 May 2025. Proposals that garnered over 50% of the participating DRep stake and selected Intersect as their Administrator advanced to this Budget Info Action. The poll artefacts are publicly available (see references below). All proposal content was timestamped at the close of the temperature-check poll and now published to IPFS as part of this on-chain submission, creating an immutable record.\n\n**On-Chain Approval & Oversight**\n\n**Budget Info Action & Net Change Limit**\n\nThe 39 qualifying proposals have been bundled into this single Budget Info Action for DRep ratification. While the total requested funding sits below the Net Change Limit (NCL) currently in force, 350 trillion lovelace, or 350 million ada, as of 8 May 2025, the NCL itself can be amended by a separate Info Action at any time. Consequently, each subsequent Treasury Withdrawal must be presented and approved only if it remains within the then-active NCL, in line with Article IV of the Cardano Constitution and Guardrail: TREASURY-02a.\n\nAlthough all included proposals have requested Intersect as their Administrator, this designation is not automatically guaranteed. Ahead of any Treasury Withdrawal governance action, proposers will be required to undergo due diligence, including KYC/KYB and other background and verification checks. Intersect reserves the right to decline or withdraw its role as Administrator if a proposal fails to meet these requirements, and remains at its discretion.\n\n**Treasury Withdrawal & Fund Management**\n\nOnce ratified, Intersect - named as the Administrator in every proposal included in this budget allocation - will submit Treasury Withdrawal governance action(s) for DReps to approve the release of funds from the Cardano Treasury. Safeguards include:\n\n- Wherever possible and applicable, multi-sig controlled smart-contract decentralized escrow with signers from Intersect, independent auditors, and other appointed bodies. Being developed by Sundae Labs.\n- Disbursements from smart contracts or related accounts will be executed in line with the proposal\u2019s contractual terms and subject to regular oversight, reporting, and - where applicable - milestone acceptance. These will be public via a new community dashboard.\n- Audit and pause-payment capability allow funds to be paused if contractual terms are breached. After arbitration, any undisbursed funds remaining in the smart contract or related accounts will be returned to the Cardano Treasury.\n- On-chain transparency: every payment is publicly traceable, and Intersect\u2019s delivery assurance team working with elected committees will publish progress reports for community oversight.\n\n**Outcome**\n\nThrough community signalling, DRep ratification, adaptable NCL compliance, and smart-contract oversight (wherever applicable and available), Cardano can fund the 2025 roadmap and supporting initiatives confidently - allocating Treasury resources responsibly while retaining the agility to adapt to future economic parameters.\n\nThe provisions set forth in the Cardano Constitution state that the approval of a Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem budget requires a threshold of greater than 50% of the active voting DRep stake and that Constitutional Committee members shall record a vote on-chain that sets forth their opinion as to whether the proposed budget, if it were to be implemented in the form contained in the \u201cInfo\u201d action, would violate this Constitution. Therefore, this Budget Info Action will be considered passed with a DRep vote of greater than or equal to 50% +1 lovelace and a Constitutional Committee vote of at least 5 of 7 members.",
          "motivation": "On March 30, the Cardano community approved the \u201cDefining the Cardano Vision and Roadmap for 2025 and Beyond\u201d Info Action, establishing the foundations for building and anchoring a budget to support its delivery. The budget socialization process - facilitated by Intersect in collaboration with the Cardano community and DRep participation - was designed to be inclusive, with no formal criteria required to take part. It supports the ongoing operation, maintenance, and future development of the Cardano blockchain ecosystem and implementation, administration and maintenance of the decentralized, on-chain governance processes  (as outlined in Article IV, Section 1).\n\nThis budget represents an aggregate allocation from the Cardano Treasury covering a multi-period timeframe, as defined in the individual proposals included herein. The total amount of ada withdrawn from the Treasury is subject to due diligence requirements in Intersect\u2019s role as an Administrator - including KYC/KYB and sanctions compliance - the satisfaction of contractually negotiated milestones and terms, and remaining within an approved and active Net Change Limit. Each withdrawal must be approved through a separate Treasury Withdrawal governance action.\n\nThe proposals included in this budget below reflect those signaled \u201cyes\u201d by DReps during the final temperature check via the polling tool Ekklesia, which concluded at 23:59 UTC on May 5, 2025:\n\n- 96,817,080 ada: 2025 Input Output Engineering Core Development Proposal\n- 69,459,000 ada: Catalyst 2025 Proposal by Input Output: Advancing Decentralised Community Innovation Funding & Infrastructure\n- 26,848,000 ada: Input Output Research (IOR): Cardano Vision - Work Program 2025\n- 15,750,000 ada: A member-based organization for the Cardano ecosystem: Intersect\n- 12,000,000 ada: Cardano Builder DAO\n- 11,070,323 ada: TWEAG\u2019s Proposals for multiple core budget projects for Cardano 2025\n- 6,000,000 ada: Cardano Summit 2025 and regional tech events\n- 6,000,000 ada: Unveiling the First Unified Global Events Marketing Strategy for Cardano\n- 5,885,000 ada: OSC Budget Proposal - Paid Open Source Model for Sustainable Development\n- 4,000,000 ada: Expanding Stablecoin / Cardano Native Asset Support / Fiat Ramps\n- 3,126,000 ada: Ecosystem Exchange Listing and Market Making service pool\n- 3,000,000 ada: High-yield RWA Asset for Cardano : Tokenized Real Estate\n- 2,162,096 ada: Midgard - Optimistic Rollups\n- 1,500,000 ada: Complement Catalyst: Extended Quadratic Funding\u2014Zero Operational Costs\n- 1,300,000 ada: Blockfrost Platform community budget proposal\n- 1,161,000 ada: zkFold ZK Rollup\n- 1,119,333 ada: Cardano Ecosystem Pavilions at Exhibitions\n- 750,000 ada: Cardano Product Committee: Community-driven 2030 Cardano Vision and 2026 roadmap insights collection via workshops and structured product research\n- 700,000 ada: ZK Bridge\n- 657,692 ada: Scalus - DApps Development Platform\n- 605,000 ada: A free Native Asset CDN for Cardano Developers\n- 600,000 ada: Complete Web3 developer stack to make Cardano the smart contract layer for Bitcoin\n- 592,780 ada: Beyond Minimum Viable Governance: Iteratively Improving on Cardano Voltaire\n- 583,000 ada: Eternl Maintenance\n- 578,571 ada: Gerolamo - cardano node in typescript\n- 424,800 ada: Hardware Wallets Maintenance\n- 314,800 ada: PyCardano\n- 300,000 ada: Ledger App Rewrite\n- 266,667 ada: Cexplorer.io \u2013 Developer-Focused Blockchain Explorer for Cardano\n- 243,478 ada: MLabs Core Tool Maintenance & Enhancement: Plutarch\n- 220,914 ada: Dolos: Sustaining a Lightweight Cardano Data Node\n- 220,914 ada: Pallas: Sustaining Critical Rust Tooling for Cardano\n- 220,914 ada: UTxO RPC: Sustaining Cardano Blockchain Integration\n- 212,000 ada: AdaStat.net Cardano blockchain explorer\n- 199,911 ada: OpShin - Python Smart Contracts for Cardano\n- 130,903 ada: Lucid Evolution Maintenance\n- 104,347 ada: MLabs Research towards Tooling for Elliptical Curves - GrumpleStiltSkin\n- 99,600 ada: BloxBean Java Tools Maintenance and Enhancement\n- 45,217 ada: MLabs Core Tool Maintenance & Enhancement: Cardano.nix\n\n**Total allocation:** The budget request that Intersect will administer is not to exceed 275,269,340 ada (275,269,340,000,000 lovelace), subject to the associated Treasury Withdrawals remaining within an approved and active Net Change Limit.

          "title": "2025 Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget - 7.5M \u20b3 for community builders",
          "abstract": "The Cardano 2025 on-chain budget process introduces a constitutionally driven, community-led model for treasury allocation. ADA holders, through Delegated Representatives (DReps) and Constitutional Committee oversight, vote on funding proposals within a capped Net Change Limit of 350 million ADA. The process includes two stages: community signaling and a binding on-chain Info Action vote.\nIntersect, a member-based organization, facilitates the process by organizing submissions and offering domain expertise, while final decisions rest with the community. Intersect also serves as the administrator for the use of approved funds.\nCurrent metrics show 11.22B ADA delegated, with 3.92B cast in Ekklesia\u201472% participation of active voting power. Yet, several proposals advanced without meeting a basic 50 + 1 Lovelace% threshold (2.69B ADA), raising concerns about legitimacy and governance integrity.\nThis info action aim to help community builders to quickly get approval onchain while individually they might not have 100k ADA deposit readily available. We submit all proposals (except founding entity proposals) that have met the 2.69B threshold for inclusion. Without respecting the safeguards put in place within the Cardano Constitution, low-support proposals may continue to pass, risking public confidence within the entire budgetary process. \nThe 2025 budget process reflects Cardano\u2019s Voltaire vision\u2014but its long-term success depends on transparency and accountability aligned with the constitution.",
          "rationale": "The 2025 Cardano budget process is built to reconcile strategic planning with decentralized authority, ensuring that treasury allocations are community-driven, constitutionally sound, and economically sustainable. It emphasizes transparency, voting legitimacy, and fiscal restraint\u2014all within the framework of the Cardano Constitution and Net Change Limit (NCL).\n\n---\n\n### 1. Proposal Submission & Consolidation\n\nThe process began with dual intake:\n\n- **Block Budgets** from Intersect\u2019s seven working committees (technical, governance, marketing, etc.)\n- **Open Submissions** from any Cardano contributor, regardless of Intersect membership.\n\nAll submissions were standardized\u2014detailing problem, benefit, roadmap alignment, and cost\u2014to ensure fair and structured evaluation. Founding entities (Intersect, IOG, Cardano Foundation, Emurgo) were expected to submit **independent Info Actions** and were **not bundled** with the general budget. This ensures neutrality and reinforces that **this budget includes only community and committee proposals that met threshold\u2014excluding those from founding entities**.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Community Signaling\n\nAn off-chain signaling phase enabled DReps and ADA holders to express preliminary support via GovTool and Ekklesia. Only proposals that achieved **more than 50% approval by voting power** (a minimum of **2.69 billion ADA**, or 50%+1 Lovelace of the 5.38B active voting stake) were advanced to the *Budget Info Action*.\n\nEkklesia recorded just **3.92B in voting participation**, raising concerns that **proposals receiving less than 2.69B ADA in support\u2014but still included\u2014would not represent majority consensus**. This budget seeks to correct that by **excluding all proposals that failed to meet the full quorum** and by **removing founding entity proposals**, even if they surpassed the threshold. This aims to address prior practices resembling **voter engineering or gerrymandering**, where under-supported proposals were pushed through by bundling or procedural manipulation.\n\n---\n\n### 3. On-Chain Budget Approval (Budget Info Action)\n\nProposals that passed community signaling with >2.69B ADA were packaged into this *Budget Info Action* for on-chain ratification. In accordance with **Article IV of the Cardano Constitution**, a valid budget requires:\n\n- A **DRep vote surpassing 50%+1 Lovelace of active voting power** (\u22652.69B ADA)\n- A **minimum of 5 out of 7 Constitutional Committee votes** affirming that the budget complies with the Constitution\n- All treasury disbursements to remain **within the 2025 Net Change Limit** (350 million ADA)\n\n---\n\nThis *Budget Info Action* complies with all of the above. DReps now vote knowing that **only proposals that passed the threshold and are constitutionally sound are included**.",

The total treasury allocation adheres to the community-approved Net Change Limit (NCL) of \u20b3350 million ada, reflecting our shared commitment to long-term financial sustainability.\nA key issue in the initial budget process was the misapplication of the participation threshold. The 50% + 1 Lovelace threshold was calculated based on total ada participating in the vote, rather than the active voting stake\u2014which significantly alters the democratic weight of participating DReps. This discrepancy risks enabling governance distortion through low-turnout manipulation, akin to gerrymandering.\nTo safeguard against such vulnerabilities and uphold the integrity of Cardano\u2019s governance process, this Info Action includes only those proposals submitted by community builders (that might not have 100k ADA deposit) and met the corrected threshold of 2.69B ada, equivalent to 50% + 1 Lovelace of the active registered voting stake. This ensures that community-driven proposals with broad support are prioritized.\nWe invite the founding entities to formally submit their respective budget proposals for community approval through the same transparent and constitutional mechanisms. This approach preserves fairness, encourages decentralization, and reinforces the principle that all proposals\u2014regardless of origin\u2014must meet the same community-backed standards.\n| Title                                                             | Ekklesia Vote Count Link                                                                                                                                                 | Allocation (ADA) | Ekklesia Vote Count (ADA)      |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Midgard - Optimistic Rollups                                      | [Link](https://2025budget.intersectmbo.org/ballots/680d1b63565577986442d123/proposals/680d1b64565577986442d276)                                                         | 2,162,096        | 3,580,699,128 ADA             |\n| Starstream: next gen VM[t]                                        | [Link](https://2025budget.intersectmbo.org/ballots/680d1b63565577986442d123/proposals/680d1b64565577986442d2ac)                                                         | 2,000,000        | 3,470,904,894 ADA             |\n| Blockfrost Platform community budget proposal | [Link](https://2025budget.intersectmbo.org/ballots/680d1b63565577986442d123/proposals/680d1b63565577986442d14a)                                                                                                                                                                         | 1,300,000        | 3,185,834,713 ADA             |\n| zkFold ZK Rollup                                                  | [Link](https://2025budget.intersectmbo.org/ballots/680d1b63565577986442d123/proposals/680d1b63565577986442d1c4)                                                         | 1,161,000        | 3,202,699,128 ADA             |\n| Hardware Wallets Maintenance                                      | [Link](https://2025budget.intersectmbo.org/ballots/680d1b63565577986442d123/proposals/680d1b64565577986442d2aa)                                                         | 424,800          | 3,431,605,268 ADA             |\n| Ledger App Rewrite                                                | [Link](https://2025budget.intersectmbo.org/ballots/680d1b63565577986442d123/proposals/680d1b63565577986442d202)                                                         | 300,000          | 2,829,275,087 ADA             |\n| Dolos: Sustaining a Lightweight Cardano Data Node                 | [Link](https://2025budget.intersectmbo.org/ballots/680d1b63565577986442d123/proposals/680d1b64565577986442d29a)                                                         | 220,914          | 2,695,223,782 ADA             |\n|                  | Total Allocation                                                         | 7,568,810          |              |\n\n**Total Allocation**: Sum of all proposals that met threshold of 2.69B minus the founding entity proposals\n\n**Bottom line for DReps**: The 2025 budget is guided by one core question: *What mix of spending best transforms Cardano\u2019s roadmap into real-world adoption and long-term resilience\u2014without overspending the treasury?* The proposed allocations reflect the community\u2019s best answer, shaped by 2024 cost data, strategic modeling, and public feedback.\nThis plan **excludes proposals from founding entities** (Intersect, IOG, Cardano Foundation, Emurgo) and **omits any proposal that failed to meet the 2.69B ADA threshold (50% + 1 Lovelace)**\u2014ensuring that only those with clear community support advance.

          "abstract": "The Cardano Constitution, at Article IV, Section 3, requires that before withdrawal of Treasury funds, the community must have established a Net Change Limit (NCL). This means passing a NCL in a formal on-chain governance info action. The NCL represents the maximum amount of ada which may be withdrawn from the Cardano Treasury in a given period. We believe that the NCL covering the period from the start of epoch 563 to the end of epoch 635 should be 300M ADA.",
          "rationale": "We believe that the NCL covering the period from the start of epoch 563 to the end of epoch 635 should be 300M ADA. Due to delays in the budget process, some proposals may be approved after June 2025. Since many budgets span approximately 12 months, defining the NCL for a similar period ensures continuity in Treasury-funded activities. 300M ADA is close to the expected inflow into the Treasury during this period. A 'yes' vote on this proposal means agreeing to the proposed NCL, which will replace any previous NCL if approved.",
          "motivation": "Existing and pending NCLs only cover periods through the end of 2025. However, many current and upcoming budget proposals are structured around 12-month timelines, extending into 2026. To support such proposals, a new NCL is needed that covers part of the 2026.",

It covers the whole of 2025.\n\n| Scope                                            | Owner    | Estimated effort | Resources already secured | Resources needed |\n| ---                                              | ---      | ---              | ---                       | ---              |\n| Ledger                                           | Matthias | 2.5 FTEs         | 1 FTE                     | 1.5 FTEs         |\n| Consensus and simulation                         | Arnaud   | 2.5 FTEs         | 1 FTE                     | 1.5 FTEs         |\n| Networking                                       | Santiago | 1 FTE            | 1 FTE                     | 0 FTEs           |\n| Ad-hoc Mercenaries                               | Pi       | 2.5 FTEs         | 0 FTEs                    | 2.5 FTEs         |\n| Project Management, Public Relations & Marketing | Damien   | 0.5 FTEs         | 0 FTEs                    | 0.5 FTEs         |\n\nThe total resources without funding for 2025 adds up to **6 FTEs**. Considering this budget ask is only for **the second half of 2025**, it halves to `$600,000` (600K) once converted to USD (`$`). We then add a 25% contingency budget to cope with our optimistic bias: we are aware that our forecast is subject to underestimating complexity, overlooking challenges, and undervaluing the time and cost required to deliver.\n\nWith this contingency, we end up at **`$750,000` (750K)**. Finally, using a conservative conversion rate of 0.5 ADA (`\u20b3`) per USD (`$`) at the date of the withdrawal, we formulate a budget of **`\u20b31,500,000` (1.5M)**.\n\n> **NOTE**\n>\n> The Networking scope described in our [design documentation](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru/blob/main/engineering-decision-records/006-design-phase-documentation.md) is included in our proposal for reference but is already covered by a [Catalyst proposal](https://projectcatalyst.io/funds/12/cardano-open-developers/amaru-p2p-networking-component-by-txpipe). It is fully managed by Santiago.\n\n## Administration of the budget\n\nThe [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) maintainer committee will ensure **direct administration** of the budget, assisted with **an on-chain smart contract** (developed in open source, still incomplete, but aimed to be done and fully audited by the time of the first withdrawal).\n\nThe fund management, responsibilities and remuneration of contributors will follow PRAGMA's legal framework provided in annex under [PRAGMA Maintainer Committee Framework](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafkreiabxyva5lfm6zztg7tnktxvvbbucljrce7hlrp4p6hropqzfaip3y).\n\nIn addition, the smart contract's role is to ensure that the expenditure of funds is done in accordance with the scope defined in this budget and authorized by the relevant scope owners.\n\nWe recognize the following capabilities of this contract:\n\n1. **Standard withdrawal**: A scope owner asks other scope owners for money to be withdrawn from his scope.\n2. **Contingency withdrawal**: A scope owner asks other scope owners to withdraw an amount from the contingency funds.\n3. **Scope reconciliation**: A scope owner asks other scope owners for a change of ownership (or a reallocation of budget).\n4. **Contingency refund/closing**: scope owners ask to send the leftovers from the contingency budget to be sent back to the Cardano treasury.\n5. **Credential rotation**: In case of lost credentials or the departure of a scope owner, a mechanism allows the rotation of credentials to a new scope owner upon approval by all (5 out of 5) PRAGMA members (effectively capturing PRAGMA's board decision to appoint new maintainers).\n6. **Failsafe**: In the extreme scenario where credentials would be irremediably lost, thus preventing any further decision, a failsafe mechanism allows all unconsumed funds to be sent back to the Cardano treasury.\n\n## Reporting\n\n#### Quarterly reports\n\nFollowing [PRAGMA's Decision Record 006](https://github.com/pragma-org/PDRs/tree/main/PDR-0006-Project-Reporting), progress on [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) shall be **at least reported quarterly**. The content of [these reports](https://pragma.io/projects/amaru#quarterly-reports) is straightforward and includes the following:\n\n- Problems that require board attention (infrastructure, trademarks, etc.)\n- Project status (active, inactive, initiating, etc.)\n- A changelog (last committer addition)\n- Next planned steps (new releases, significant changes, etc.)\n- Reflection & Performances\n\nThis recurrent interaction will provide an overview of the project with a long-term perspective and support the maintainers' committee in aligning priorities and identifying the next steps. The outcome of these reviews will be publicly available as documentation in [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru)'s GitHub repository.\n\n#### Regular demos\n\nAmaru is demo-driven. We strive to integrate early and provide runnable examples showcasing the latest features as the project is being developed. The cadence for these demos is around 4 to 6 weeks, as illustrated on the [existing track record](https://pragma.io/projects/amaru#demos).\n\nWe will naturally continue to **record and post demos regularly**.\n\n## Constitutionality checklist\n\nBeing one of the first proposals of this nature ever submitted, it is easy to get things wrong. In an effort to convince ourselves of its constitutionality, we thought relevant to include a checklist of the points we cover and for each, our interpretation of the Cardano Constitution.\n\n#### Purpose\n\n- [x] This proposal is for work intended to enhance the security, decentralization and long-term sustainability of Cardano.\n\n#### Article III.5: the process of on-chain governance\n\n- [x] We have submitted this proposal in a standardized, legible format, which includes a URL and hash of all documented off-chain content. We believe our rationale to be detailed and sufficient. The proposal contains a title, abstract, reason for the proposal and relevant supporting materials.\n\n#### Article IV.1: proposing budgets\n\n- [x] This proposal accords with the provisions of this article as it is intended to cover the maintenance and future development of the Cardano Blockchain.\n\n- [x] This proposal covers a shorter period than 73 epochs, which is permitted in this section of the Constitution, to match the Net-Change Limit period.\n\n#### Article IV.2: funds administration\n\n- [x] This proposal specifies an administrator in accordance with this provision. It also specifies an internal administration process using smart contracts and an off-chain overseeing committee, meeting the requirements of this clause, which requires a process that may include an administrator.\n\n#### Article IV.3: Net-Change Limit\n\n- [x] Being of \u20b31.5M and covering the second half of 2025, this proposal and the treasury withdrawals it would enable do not violate the currently agreed upon Net-Change Limit.\n\n#### Article IV.4: Auditor\n\n- [x] This proposal makes provisions for an auditor (covered by the _Ad-hoc mercenaries_ scope).\n\n#### Guardrails\n\n- [x] This proposal is subject to _TREASURY-04a_ in that it defines a Cardano blockchain ecosystem budget. It requires a threshold greater than 50% of the DReps' active voting stake to be considered approved and enable subsequent withdrawals pertaining to this budget.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) project represents a major step towards node diversity through the development of a modular, high-performance, and interoperable block-producing node for Cardano. Our approach, rooted in openness, innovation, and operational resilience, aims to deliver significant advancements in blockchain technology without compromising on security.\n\nIn addition to this budget, we provide a detailed document outlining:\n\n- explicit assumptions about the project, the valuation and the scopes covered;\n- comparisons to similar projects of developing blockchain nodes; and\n- the methodology used for managing the project, its deliveries, its finance and its governance.\n\nThrough rigorous design and execution phases, we have outlined actionable scopes, realistic timelines, and comprehensive resource allocations. The detailed breakdown of scopes, funding and resources already secured reflects our commitment to transparency and efficiency. While we remain optimistic about our forecasts, we acknowledge the complexities involved and have incorporated contingencies to address unforeseen challenges.\n\nMore than a mere budget, this proposal is an invitation to collaborate and innovate together. The [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) project is ambitious yet achievable through the collective effort of our contributors and the broader Cardano community. By focusing on building, learning, and demonstrating tangible progress, [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) paves the way for a more resilient and decentralized Cardano ecosystem, ensuring long-term reliability and innovation.\n\nLet's build the future of Cardano together.",
          "motivation": "## Who we are\n\n[Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) is a multi-entity effort that currently sits under [PRAGMA](https://pragma.io): a member-based, not-for-profit open-source association for blockchain software projects. Five members with equal power currently drive PRAGMA's strategy and operations: Blink Labs, Cardano Foundation, dcSpark, Sundae Labs, and TxPipe. Each of them has a proven track record of building on Cardano and supporting our ecosystem.\n\n[Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) itself is managed by an appointed maintainer committee in charge of different scopes. The current maintainer committee comprises of:\n\n- [Arnaud Bailly](https://github.com/abailly) responsible for the consensus and simulation testing.\n- [Matthias Benkort](https://github.com/ktorz) responsible for the ledger & overall architecture.\n- [Pi Lanningham](https://github.com/Quantumplation) responsible for the ad hoc work and middleware integrations.\n- [Santiago Carmuega](https://github.com/scarmuega) responsible for the p2p networking.\n- [Damien Czapla](https://github.com/Dam-CZ) responsible for the project management, public relations & marketing.\n\nEach member of the maintainer committee is in charge of a scope and has oversight on its delivery, which includes managing an associated budget.\n\n## Why build another node\n\nOne of Cardano's key assets is its legendary robustness and stability, which is mainly attributed to the existing Haskell node, which has been working without significant disruption for about five years now (counting since the Byron reboot, circa February 2020).\n\nSo why bother with another node? The answer is, of course, plural:\n\n#### 1. **Better resource usage**\n\nSoftware is ultimately a collection of design decisions and trade-offs. Some of those trade-offs in the Haskell node have led to rather high resource usages (e.g., resident memory), thus leading to the creation of specific protocol parameters (e.g., min-utxo-value) as countermeasures to ensure resource usage remains somewhat bounded. Our analysis is that different (albeit acceptable) trade-offs would yield better resource usage.\n\n#### 2. **Industry-grade observability**\n\nObservability is challenging, and it is even more so when rolling your own solution. With [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru), we intend to embrace industry standards for monitoring, tracing, and logging to drastically enhance the user experience for operators seeking insights into their node's behaviour.\n\n#### 3. **Enhanced interoperability**\n\n[Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) being primarily written in Rust means that we can more easily leverage an existing and thriving ecosystem of blockchain solutions and aim at multiple target platforms (e.g. web-assembly, RISC-V). This opens up not only to a wide variety of potential contributors but also to many new use cases that are much harder (not to say unrealistic) to achieve with a Haskell node.\n\n#### 4. **Higher-assurance & robustness**\n\nDeveloping a new implementation of existing software means dissecting every part of the original implementation. Along the way, bugs and discrepancies with the specification are commonly found through conformance testing. Gaps in the documentation can also be identified and addressed. The development of [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) has already proven this on several occasions. In the long run, more node implementations can be a synonym for reduced development time by allowing all implementations to converge faster towards better designs and more robust implementations.\n\n#### 5. **Decentralization**\n\nIn a world where Byzantine fault tolerance is at the centre and where decentralization is a paramount value, we believe that a single-node implementation presents a single point of failure and a central point of control. A new node not only increases the overall resilience of the network but also provides perspectives in terms of a roadmap and use cases.\n\n---\n\nWith [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru), we believe that we can reconcile these goals while preserving Cardano's focus on security and robustness. Like Haskell, Rust is a statically typed language that provides strong compile-time guarantees and fine-grained memory management. Its ecosystem is also well-equipped for high assurance, making it a sane choice for implementing blockchain solutions.",

          "title": "2025 Cardano NCL",
          "abstract": "The Cardano Constitution, at Article IV, Section 3, requires that before withdrawal of Treasury funds, the community must have established a Net Change Limit (NCL). This means passing a NCL in a formal on-chain governance info action. The NCL represents the maximum amount of ada which may be withdrawn from the Cardano Treasury in a given period. It is a guardrail which, by definition in the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Constitution Definitions referenced below, protects the sustainability of the Cardano Treasury by preventing excessive withdrawals.",
          "rationale": "Article IV, Section I of the Cardano Constitution states: \u201cThe Cardano Community may propose one aggregate budget or multiple budgets for the Cardano Blockchain ecosystem. Such budgets are expected to cover not less than a period of 73 epochs (approximately one calendar year) but nothing shall prevent the Cardano Community from proposing budgets for shorter or longer time periods (emphasis added).\n\nAt this time, there are approximately eight (8) months left of 2025. It will take at least 30\u201360 more days to pass a budget. We believe the NCL for 2025, covering the period from the start of Epoch 532 to the end of Epoch 604, should be 200M ada.\n\nThere are several reasons for this. Members of the Cardano community have generated models showing 350M+/- ada per calendar year was added to the Cardano Treasury in 2024 and therefore, setting NCL at 350M ada preserves the Treasury principal. Regardless of whether such models are accurate, we believe that the community should not set NCL so high at first. There is no reason not to continue to grow the Treasury while the community sorts out its priorities for development and its funding processes.\n\nThis NCL guides the first budget \u2018experiment\u2019 of the first ever on-chain Cardano governance. The community has never before been solely responsible for payment to core Cardano developers and has little first-hand knowledge of those expenses. The community is still working out budget processes and evaluating proposed budgets as well as determining appropriate audit and administration methods. For the 2025 year, we should be cautious, while at the same time, permitting use of Treasury funds to continue core maintenance, enhance scaling and other goals. We need to evaluate the impacts to the ecosystem of this funding, the administration of the budget, and the effect of selling 200M ada in a short period of time. We need to let our budget processes mature and to understand risks they may pose to Treasury and the Cardano protocol. A new NCL can and should be set for 2026 after the community has more experience behind it. This may result in an increase, or a decrease, in the limit set in future NCLs.\n\nThis NCL shall be applied to budget actions and treasury withdrawal actions to ensure compliance with Article IV of the Cardano Constitution and the Treasury Withdrawal Guardrails specified in Appendix I.\n\nA vote in favor of this proposal shall indicate agreement with the proposed NCL, allowing for the submission of budget info actions and treasury withdrawal governance actions. The maximum amount that can be withdrawn from the treasury during the specified period shall not exceed the total sum outlined herein.\n\nThe provisions set forth in the Cardano Constitution state that the approval of a NCL requires a threshold of greater than 50% of the active voting DRep stake. Therefore, this NCL will be considered passed if it is greater than 50+1 lovelace%.\n\nIn the event of conflict, this NCL supersedes any prior NCL covering all or part of calendar year 2025.",
          "motivation": "No funds may be withdrawn from the Cardano Treasury without establishing a NCL. If the community wishes to use the Treasury to continue to maintain and grow the Cardano ecosystem it\u2019s necessary to establish a NCL.",

          "abstract": "The Cardano Constitution requires the establishment of a Net Change Limit, which defines the maximum amount of lovelace that can be withdrawn from the treasury during an outlined period of time. This governance action serves as an opportunity for all governance stakeholders to formally express their positions regarding the proposed Net Change Limit, ensuring transparency, accountability, and alignment across the ecosystem.\n\nThis Net Change Limit facilitates a yearly budget cycle for the Cardano community. The 2025 Net Change Limit will begin at the start of Epoch 532 and continue for 72 epochs, finishing at the conclusion of Epoch 604 in December 2025. The 2025 Net Change Limit will be 350,000,000,000,000 lovelace (350M ada). This is the maximum amount that can be withdrawn from the treasury during this specific period and shall not be exceeded.\n\nThe Net Change Limit will be used when reviewing both budget actions and treasury withdrawal actions to ensure constitutionality as required by Article IV of the Cardano Constitution and the Treasury Withdrawal Guardrails outlined in Appendix I.",
          "rationale": "As agreed with the Cardano Budget Committee, the 2025 Net Change Limit shall begin at the start of Epoch 532 and progress for 72 epochs, concluding in December 2025 at the end of Epoch 604.\n\nThe 2025 Net Change Limit shall be set at 350,000,000,000,000 lovelace (350M ada).\n\nThis figure is derived from our modeling, which projected in October 2024 that the treasury would increase by approximately 351M ada across 2024 (epoch 459-531), including all approved withdrawals (e.g., Catalyst). Based on this analysis, the 2025 Net Change Limit was proposed at 350m ada. From January 5th, 2024, Epoch 459, through December 30th, Epoch 531, the actual total income into the Cardano Treasury was 335,957,093 ada. Since this is within 5% of our proposed number, the 2025 Net Change Limit should stay at 350 million ada.\n\nWe propose that the Net Change Limit be set based on the previous year\u2019s total treasury inflows, creating a direct incentive for projects to enhance utility on the blockchain. This approach ensures that funded initiatives drive greater value across the broader ecosystem. We aim to support sustainable growth and long-term advancements within the Cardano network by fostering innovation, efficiency, and real-world applicability.\n\nThis limit shall be applied in assessing budget actions and treasury withdrawal actions to ensure compliance with Article IV of the Cardano Constitution and the Treasury Withdrawal Guardrails specified in Appendix I.\n\nA vote in favor of this proposal shall indicate agreement with the proposed Net Change Limit, allowing for the submission of budget info actions and treasury withdrawal governance actions. The maximum amount that can be withdrawn from the treasury during this specific period shall not exceed the total sum outlined herein.\n\nDuring the socialization of this Net Change Limit, we received feedback from the community that, since the Net Change Limit controls the total amount that can be withdrawn from the treasury in a specified period, the DRep ratification threshold for the Net Change Limit should be set at 67% of the treasury withdrawal parameter percentage. We neither agree nor disagree; however, we recognize that this Net Change Limit must adhere to the guidance outlined in the Cardano Constitution.\n\nThe provisions set forth in the Cardano Constitution state that the approval of a Net Change Limit requires a threshold of greater than 50% of the active voting DRep stake. Therefore, this Net Change Limit will be considered passed if it is greater than 50+1 lovelace%.",
          "motivation": "Prior to the submission of any budget request, a Net Change Limit must be formally agreed upon by delegate representatives (Article IV Section 3 of the Constitution). Failure to establish a Net Change Limit shall render any such budget request unconstitutional and, therefore, inapplicable.\n\nThe 2025 Net Change Limit will be effective for the period specified in this action. To support the ecosystem, a 2026 Net Change Limit will be established based on modeling but will remain separate from this governance action.",

          "abstract": "This governance proposal seeks to reduce the treasury cut from 20% to 10% to enhance staking incentives, improve decentralization, and align economic sustainability with the Cardano ecosystem's long term growth. The adjustment aims to optimize staking rewards without compromising the financial health of the treasury, ensuring a balanced economic model that incentivizes participation and network security.",
          "rationale": "## Rationale\n\nThe proposal seeks to reduce the treasury cut from 20% to 10%, increasing staking rewards and incentivizing greater participation in governance. This adjustment strengthens decentralization and network security while maintaining a sustainable treasury.\n\n## Precedent: Plutus V3 Cost Model Update\n\nThe Plutus V3 cost model update demonstrates how governance-driven parameter adjustments can optimize Cardano's economic and technical framework. That update enabled new cryptographic primitives without disrupting existing functionality. This proposal follows a similar structured approach to fine-tune economic incentives while adhering to governance protocols.\n\nRather than equating this action with the Plutus cost model update, it should be framed as a governance-driven economic refinement. The similarity lies in their procedural approach. Both actions modify key parameters through structured governance processes to optimize Cardano's functionality and incentive structures.\n\n## Mathematical Justification\n\nCardano's staking reward system is governed by the formula:\n\n$$ R_{\\text{epoch}} = M \\times (\\text{monetaryExpansion}) + T $$\n\nwhere $`R_{\\text{epoch}}`$ is the total rewards distributed per epoch, $`M`$ represents the remaining ADA reserves, and $`T`$ is the total transaction fees collected in that epoch. The treasury cut is applied before distribution:\n\n$$ R_{\\text{stakers}} = (1 - \\text{treasuryCut}) \\times R_{\\text{epoch}} $$\n\nUnder the current 20% tax:\n\n$$ R_{\\text{stakers}} = 0.80 \\times R_{\\text{epoch}} $$\n\nReducing the tax to 10% results in:\n\n$$ R_{\\text{stakers}} = 0.90 \\times R_{\\text{epoch}} $$\n\nThis equates to a 12.5% increase in staking rewards across the network. Assuming a baseline staking APY of 4.0%, the reduction would increase APY to approximately 4.5%.\n\n## Constitutional Alignment\n\nThe new constitution explicitly permits treasury cuts between 10% and 30% (Appendix I, Section 2.1: TC-01, TC-02). The interim constitution also establishes governance guidelines that align with maintaining financial stability (Article III, Section 3). This governance action remains within those limits and upholds fiscal sustainability principles. It does not alter governance structures but optimizes staking incentives.\n\n## Justification Based on Cardano's Economic Landscape\n\nThis proposal should be justified by Cardano's staking participation rates, treasury utilization, and historical transaction volume. Rather than relying on direct comparisons to external blockchains, the focus should be on positioning Cardano as a highly competitive ecosystem that maximizes staking incentives and treasury efficiency. Ensuring an optimal balance between treasury funding and staking rewards will attract users and developers, particularly during the most competitive phases of market cycles, reinforcing Cardano's long-term adoption and growth.\n\n## Governance Transition Considerations\n\nThe new constitution introduces improved treasury oversight and decentralized decision-making (Article IV, Sections 1-3). This proposal aligns with those mechanisms. It acknowledges the strengthened governance framework and ensures compliance with voting requirements for economic parameter changes.\n\n## Referencing Constitutional Guardrails\n\nThe original 20% treasury cut was an arbitrary level set at the beginning of Shelley and has never been reassessed. It was not based on economic modeling or sustainability projections but rather as a starting point in the early phases of the network. Now, with a more mature ecosystem, this governance action proposes an adjustment to align with long-term realities.\n\nThe primary mechanism that ensures treasury sustainability is **ADA price appreciation** rather than relying solely on transaction volume growth. At significantly higher ADA valuations, the treasury will remain well-funded even with a lower tax rate. This can be expressed as:\n\n$$ T_{\\text{future}} = T_{\\text{current}} \\times \\frac{P_{\\text{future}}}{P_{\\text{current}}} $$\n\nwhere $`T_{\\text{future}}`$ represents the future treasury value, $`T_{\\text{current}}`$ is the current treasury balance, and $`P_{\\text{future}}`$ and $`P_{\\text{current}}`$ represent the future and current price of ADA, respectively.\n\nAt higher ADA valuations, treasury reserves will remain sufficient to fund governance, development, and long-term initiatives without over-relying on a high tax rate. This adjustment strikes a balance between incentivizing participation and ensuring treasury sustainability.\n\n## Benefits to the Ecosystem\n\nReducing the treasury cut increases direct staking incentives, strengthening security by encouraging wider participation in staking. Higher staking rewards improve decentralization, as more ADA holders are motivated to delegate, reducing centralization risks among stake pools.\n\nThis change strengthens staking incentives and decentralization while ensuring the treasury remains well-funded under a sustainable long-term model. The original 20% treasury cut was set arbitrarily at the start of Shelley and has never been adjusted. Now that Cardano has matured, a lower treasury cut realigns incentives with network security and participant rewards.\n\nAt higher ADA prices, the treasury retains substantial purchasing power even with a reduced cut. This can be expressed as:\n\n$$ T_{\\text{future}} = T_{\\text{current}} \\times \\frac{P_{\\text{future}}}{P_{\\text{current}}} + \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\alpha \\cdot T_0 \\cdot (1 + g)^i $$\n\nwhere $`T_{{future}}`$ represents the future treasury value, $`T_{\\text{current}}`$ is the current treasury balance, $`P_{\\text{future}}`$ and $`P_{\\text{current}}`$ represent the future and current price of ADA, and the second term accounts for treasury inflows from transaction fees, where $`\\alpha`$ is the proportion allocated to the treasury, $`T_0`$ is the initial transaction revenue, and $`g`$ is the growth rate of transaction volume.\n\nA lower treasury cut not only increases staking rewards but also shifts economic incentives toward sustainable growth. Developers and projects will be encouraged to build products that drive real transaction activity rather than focusing on treasury allocations as a primary funding source. While increased transaction volume contributes to treasury inflows, the most significant long-term driver of treasury sustainability remains **ADA price appreciation**.\n\nThis adjustment enhances network security, incentivizes ecosystem participation, and promotes a more organic and sustainable approach to funding, ensuring that Cardano remains competitive while maintaining financial stability.\n\n## Governance Efficiency and Competitive Resource Allocation\n\nA leaner treasury encourages competitive grant proposals and more strategic allocation of resources. With a more dynamic and utility-driven economic model, Cardano strengthens its position as an attractive environment for developers and enterprises looking to build scalable blockchain applications.\n\n## Ensuring Continuity and Preventing Disruptions\n\nTo prevent conflicts with the governance transition, this proposal recognizes the role of **DReps, SPOs, and the Constitutional Committee** in treasury management (Article III, Section 2). It remains within the guardrails and economic sustainability principles of both the interim and new constitutional frameworks. A structured review mechanism can be introduced to assess its impact over time and make future adjustments if needed.\n\n## Review and Governance Compliance\n\nThis proposal follows past governance action formats, incorporates economic impact analysis, and ensures alignment with constitutional parameters. It prioritizes Cardano's staking and treasury ecosystem without introducing unnecessary external references. The focus remains on sustainable network incentives and broad economic viability.",
          "motivation": "The initial 20% treasury cut was set arbitrarily at the launch of Shelley and has never been reassessed. With Cardano's ecosystem maturing and a more structured governance framework in place, it is now possible to refine economic parameters to better align with network incentives. A lower treasury cut increases staking rewards, encourages broader participation, and strengthens security while maintaining a sustainable treasury. This adjustment ensures that governance decisions support long term ecosystem growth.",

A series of global workshops for Ada holders to discuss and debate the Articles of a final constitution will commence during the second half of 2024: 2 beta workshops and 63 constitutional workshops were held from July - October 2024.\n2. Workshops shall be geographically distributed to capture the breadth of sentiment in the Cardano community: the 63 workshops took place in 52 countries.\n3. Workshops shall elect up to a total of one hundred and forty delegates comprising up to seventy voting delegates and up to seventy non-voting alternate delegates, who shall participate in a Constitutional Convention. Each voting delegate participating in the Constitutional Convention shall have an equal vote: 63 voting delegates and 63 non-voting alternates were elected by the workshop attendees.  63 delegates cast their vote, each with one vote, at the Constitutional Convention on 5 December 2024.\n4. The Constitutional Convention shall be held no later than the end of 2024: The Constitutional Convention was in session from 4-6 December 2024.\n5. The Final Constitution shall be approved at the Constitutional Convention where delegates elected to attend the Constitutional Convention shall agree to the Final Constitution with such amendments as they deem appropriate and necessary: The Final Constitution was approved by the Delegates at the Cardano Convention by a 95% margin.\n6. The Final Constitution as approved at the Constitutional Convention shall be submitted as a governance action in accordance with CIP-1694 no later than January 31, 2025: This governance action, containing the Constitution as approved at the Constitutional Convention, was submitted on 30 January, 2025.",
          "motivation": "**CIP-1694**\nThe age of Voltaire for the Cardano Blockchain laid out the foundations for decentralized decision-making. To give effect to true governance by all ada owners, including on-chain voting, members of the Cardano Community worked together for more than a year, holding global workshops, to ultimately approve a Cardano Improvement Proposal, CIP-1694, that provides a governance system to bring decision making for the Cardano Blockchain network on-chain. CIP-1694 was first published November 18, 2022, as a minimum viable on-chain governance framework. CIP-1694 assures that every ada owner has a voice in Cardano\u2019s governance. Following these global workshops and extensive Cardano Community participation, a refined version of CIP-1694 emerged.\n\nPursuant to CIP-1694, the Cardano Community is now able to present proposals, such as this proposal, to improve and update the Cardano Blockchain network. To enable this, a set of rules, parameters and guardrails must be in place to secure the safety and security of the Cardano Blockchain. CIP-1694 requires that these rules, parameters and guardrails be set out in a constitution that defines Cardano's shared values and guiding principles.\n\n**Chang Hard Fork**\nTwo upgrades (or hard forks) to the Cardano Blockchain protocol were required to fully give effect to CIP-1694. The first upgrade, Chang Hard Fork, was initiated by the Genesis Key Holders and approved by Cardano Blockchain stake pool operators (SPOs) and became effective on September 1, 2024.  The Chang Hard Fork deployed the initial on-chain governance features to the Cardano Blockchain and ushered in an interim (or bootstrap phase) for Cardano Blockchain on-chain governance as described in CIP-1694.\n\nTo give effect to the bootstrap phase of minimum viable on-chain governance, as required by CIP-1694, an interim Cardano Blockchain constitution was published on June 21, 2024.  This interim constitution is a temporary governing document containing only the minimal  requirements necessary for Chang Hard Fork to be implemented.  The bootstrap phase also required that an interim Constitutional Committee be elected by the Cardano Community. Once the Cardano Constitution is approved pursuant to an on-chain vote, the interim constitution will be replaced.  The term of the interim Constitutional Committee members expires in September 2025 (Epoch 580) and at that time the Cardano Community will be able to elect a new Constitutional Committee.\n\n**Plomin Hard Fork**\nThe second upgrade (or intra-era hard fork) to the Cardano Blockchain moved CIP-1694 out of the interim bootstrap phase and into full minimum viable on-chain governance as described in CIP-1694. To fully implement on-chain governance, the Cardano Community will now need to ratify this proposed Cardano Constitution on-chain.\n\n**Achieving Consensus on the Cardano Constitution**\nOn behalf of the Cardano Community, the Constitution Ratification Working Group (CRWG) of the Cardano Civics Committee of Intersect brought together representatives of the Cardano Community, blockchain governance and constitutional scholars and the Cardano Parameter Committee to develop the Cardano Constitution.\n\nUsing the Interim Constitution as a starting point, this group prepared a first draft of a constitution that was then submitted in July 2024 to representatives from the Cardano Community who volunteered to participate in a series of global community workshops. Between July and October 2024, 63 workshops were held in over 50 countries and involved more than 1,400 participants.\n\nEach workshop, as well as others from the Cardano Community via an online open form, reviewed and provided feedback and recommendations on the July draft. Each workshop also elected a Constitutional Delegate and Alternate to represent the views of their workshop at the Constitutional Convention.\n\nAs part of helping to organize the 63 global workshops, the CRWG identified the most complex issues that arose from the initial drafting process. The CRWG asked workshops to provide feedback on these issues. Each workshop chose which issues they particularly wanted to focus on. Output from the workshops, together with open-ended community feedback, shaped the edits that were made to the July draft.\n\nThe workshop data was reviewed by the CRWG and Parameter Committee, as well as the group of blockchain governance and constitutional scholars and turned into proposed revisions. The Delegates and Alternates met in a series of online and in-person workshops to synthesize the output from the global workshops and review the resulting proposed revisions to the draft Constitution. In these workshops, Delegates were asked to review the proposed changes in light of their workshop\u2019s feedback and work as a group to settle on the best path forward. This often took the form of debates, problem solving, and compromise. Using that output, the Delegates and Alternates, again working with the CRWG, the Parameter Committee and a group of blockchain governance and constitutional scholars, revised the July draft constitution. That work resulted in a subsequent 20 November 2024 draft constitution that was released to the Cardano Community.\n\nBased on further community feedback, the Delegates and Alternates continued to review and make additional revisions to the November draft. They also took into consideration other community input including a draft constitution that was published by the Cardano Foundation and based on the November draft. Delegates, Alternates and other Cardano Community members continued to iterate on the draft constitution until reaching final consensus at the Constitutional Convention. The proposed Cardano Constitution was overwhelmingly approved by the Delegates at the Constitutional Convention by a 95% margin. On that basis, the Delegates and CRWG are putting forward this governance action for consideration by all owners of ada.\n\nNevertheless, the CRWG, the Delegates, Alternates and others involved in the drafting process all recognize that the proposed Cardano Constitution is not perfect. It is not an end, only the beginning. Over time, as all those involved to date recognize, the Cardano Constitution may need to be revised and improved. The Cardano Constitution also acknowledges this by providing an amendment process.\n\nFurther, in the Delegate synthesis workshops, the Delegates and Alternates identified a number of future governance workstreams. The Cardano Community will be invited to organize and participate during 2025 in various future governance workshops. These future workshops will focus on various governance considerations such as governance processes and procedures that should not appropriately be included in a constitution, governance processes that the Constitution requires the community to implement to give effect to various constitutional mandates, and potential future amendments to the Constitution that may become appropriate based on review and feedback as to how governance processes are working.",

DRep voting will be enabled on all 7 governance actions;\n4. SPO voting will be enabled on all applicable governance actions, as defined in CIP-1694;\n5.

This can be used to inform risk management.\n\n\n### Functionality\n\nThe upgrade enables two main items: \n\n\n\n\n1. The remainder of the CIP-1694 functionality, as described below - notably: DRep voting on all action types, the remaining governance actions, and restrictions on rewards withdrawals.\n2. New Plutus primitives as described below.\n\nOtherwise, all existing functionality from Protocol Version 9 will be maintained.\n\nFull testing reports have been produced for the Cardano node that demonstrate:\n\n\n\n1. No behavioral regressions for existing functionality;\n2. Conformance between the specification and implementation of the Cardano node for the new CIP-1694 functionality;\n3. Correct operation of the new Plutus primitives.\n\n\n### Security\n\nSecurity audits have been undertaken for: \n\n\n\n\n1. The formal specification for CIP-1694 in Agda;\n2. The ledger implementation in Haskell that corresponds to this formal specification.\n\n\n### Performance\n\n[Performance results for Cardano Node version 10.1.1](https://updates.cardano.intersectmbo.org/reports/2024-10-performance-10.1.1/) show no regressions from previous versions of the Cardano node for the standard value and Plutus benchmarks, and acceptable baseline performance for the new voting benchmark.\n\n\n### Sustainability\n\nThe upgrade provides new functionality that will enhance existing governance capabilities. It also provides new Plutus functionality that will enhance its bitwise and cryptographic capabilities and provide better interoperability with BitCoin and Ethereum.\n\n\n\n## New Functionality that will be enabled by the Upgrade\n\n\n### DRep Voting Changes following the Upgrade \n \nDReps will be able to vote on all 7 types of governance action, as described in CIP-1694, and will no longer be restricted to voting on Info actions. \n\n\n\n### New Governance Actions that will be Available following the Upgrade\n\nFour new governance actions will be enabled as described in CIP-1694.\n\n1. Treasury withdrawals.  Funds may be withdrawn from the treasury and deposited in designated stake credentials.\n2. New constitution/guardrails script.  A new constitution may be proposed and/or a new guardrails script may be proposed.\n3. Updates to the constitutional committee. Constitutional committee members may be removed, replaced, or new members may be elected.  The threshold for Constitutional committee voting may also be changed.\n4. Votes of no confidence.  A vote of no confidence may be raised.\n\n\n### Other Governance Changes following the Upgrade\n\nThe main other governance changes in Protocol Version 10 are:\n\n1. Rewards will still be accumulated by Ada holders when delegating to stake pools for block production as in Protocol Version 9 and before, but these rewards can only be withdrawn once the Ada holder has also delegated their stake to a DRep for voting purposes.  This vote delegation may be to a self-created DRep, to a third-party DRep, or to the pre-defined Abstain or No Confidence DReps.\n2. SPO votes will default to **No**.  It will be possible for SPOs to default to **Abstain** or **No Confidence** by delegating their reward address to the pre-defined DRep. \n\n\n## New Plutus Primitives that will be Enabled after the Plomin Hard Fork\n\n\nThe new Plutus primitives are defined in three CIPs: [CIP-0122](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-0122), [CIP-0123](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-0123) and [CIP-0127](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-0127).  A separate protocol parameter update governance action has already been enacted on Cardano mainnet that updates the Plutus cost model so that these primitives will become available immediately after the Plomin Hard Fork.\n\n### CIP-0122\nBitwise operations, both over fixed-width and variable-width blocks of bits, have a range of uses, including data structures (especially succinct ones) and cryptography. Currently, operations on individual bits in Plutus Core are difficult, or outright impossible, while also keeping within the tight constraints required on-chain. While it is possible to some degree to work with individual bytes over BuiltinByteStrings, this isn't sufficient, or efficient, when bit manipulations are required.\n\nThe new Plutus primitives defined by CIP-0122 are:\n\n- Bitwise logical AND, OR, XOR and complement;\n- Reading a bit value at a given index;\n- Setting bits value at given indices; and\n- Replicating a byte a given number of times.\n\n> ``\n> andByteString, orByteString, xorByteString, complementByteString, readBit, writeBits, replicateByte\n> ``\n\n### CIP-0123\nThe new bitwise operations that are defined in CIP-0123 extend the set that is provided by CIP-0122 to provide a usefully 'complete' set of bitwise operations.\n\nThe new Plutus primitives defined by CIP-0123 are:\n\n- Bit shifts and rotations\n- Counting the number of set bits (popcount)\n- Finding the first set bit\n\n> ``\n> shiftByteString,\n> rotateByteString,\n> countSetBits,\n> findFirstSetBit\n> ``\n\n\n### CIP-0127\nThe integration of the ECDSA and Schnorr signatures over the secp256k1 curve into Plutus was a significant step towards interoperability with the Ethereum and Bitcoin ecosystems. However, full compatibility is still impossible due to the absence of the RIPEMD-160 hashing algorithm in the Plutus interpreter. This is a fundamental component of Bitcoin's cryptographic framework.\n\nAdding RIPEMD-160 support to Plutus enhances the potential for cross-chain solutions between Cardano and Bitcoin blockchains and complements the set of primitives which are already available. It will allow for the verification of Bitcoin addresses and transactions on-chain. This addition also enables the verification of signed messages that identify the signer by the public key hash, which has not yet been witnessed on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nThe new Plutus primitive defined by CIP-0127 is:\n\n- [RIPEMD-160 hashing](https://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~bosselae/ripemd160/pdf/AB-9601/AB-9601.pdf)\n\n> ``\n> ripemd_160\n> ``\n\n## Consistency with Guardrails\n\n\nThe text of the guardrails states:\n\n\n*\u201cThe hard fork initiation action requires both a new major and a new minor protocol version to be specified as positive integers.  As the result of a hard fork, new updatable protocol parameters may be introduced. Guardrails may be defined for these parameters, which will take effect following the hard fork. Existing updatable protocol parameters may also be deprecated by the hard fork, in which case the guardrails become obsolete for all future changes.\u201d*\n\nAll these conditions apply to this proposal.  The upgrade will have major protocol version 10 and minor protocol version 0.  No new updatable parameters will be introduced or deprecated.\n\nThe relevant guardrails in the Interim Constitution are:\n\n* **HARDFORK-01:** \u201cThe major protocol version must be the same as or one greater than the major version that will be enacted immediately prior to this change. If the major protocol version is one greater, then the minor protocol version must be zero.\u201d\n* **HARDFORK-02:** \u201cThe minor protocol version must be no less than the minor version that will be enacted immediately prior to this change.\u201d\n* **HARDFORK-03:** \u201cAt least one of the protocol versions (major or minor or both) must change.\u201d\n* **HARDFORK-04** \u201cAt least 85% of stake pools by active stake should have upgraded to a Cardano node version that is capable of processing the rules associated with the new protocol version.\u201d\n* **HARDFORK-05** \u201cAny new updatable protocol parameters that are introduced with a hard fork must be included in this Appendix and suitable guardrails defined for those parameters.\u201d\n* **HARDFORK-06:** \u201cSettings for any new protocol parameters that are introduced with a hard fork must be included in the appropriate Genesis file.\u201d\n* **HARDFORK-07:** \u201cAny deprecated protocol parameters must be indicated in this Appendix.\u201d\n* **HARDFORK-08:** \u201cNew Plutus versions must be supported by a version-specific Plutus cost model that covers each primitive that is available in the new Plutus version.\u201d\n* **INTERIM-01**: \u201cTo provide sufficient time for DReps to register and campaign and for Ada holders to choose their initial voting delegations, at least 18 epochs (90 days, or approximately 3 months) must elapse after the Chang hard fork before the subsequent hard fork can be ratified. Once the subsequent hard fork is enacted, DRep voting can occur as described in CIP-1694.\u201d\n\nThis governance action is consistent with all nine guardrails, provided attention is paid to HARDFORK-04, as described below.  None of these guardrails can be checked by the automated guardrails script.\n\n\n### Consistency with HARDFORK-01: \n\nThe protocol version will be changed from major version 9 (minor version 0) to major version 10 (minor version 0).\n\n\n### Consistency with HARDFORK-02: \n\nThe minor protocol version will be unchanged (0 in both cases).\n\n\n### Consistency with HARDFORK-03: \n\nThe major protocol version will change from 9 to 10.\n\n\n### Consistency with HARDFORK-04: \n\nThe stake pool upgrade status will need to be determined prior to ratification of the governance action.  If insufficient stake pools by stake have been upgraded, the action should not be ratified.\n\n\n### Consistency with HARDFORK-05: \n\nNo new updatable protocol parameters will be introduced by this hard fork, so the guardrails do not need to be updated.\n\n\n### Consistency with HARDFORK-06: \n\nNo new protocol parameters will be introduced by this hard fork, so a new Genesis file is not needed.\n\n\n### Consistency with HARDFORK-07: \n\nNo protocol parameters are deprecated by this hard fork.\n\n\n### Consistency with HARDFORK-08: \n\nNo new Plutus version is introduced.  The new Plutus primitives are provided as part of Plutus v3.\n\n### Consistency with INTERIM-01: \n\nThe Chang hard fork took place on September 1st, 2024.  More than 90 days will have elapsed prior to the submission of this governance action.\n\n\n## Reversion Plan\n\nThe hard fork represents a permanent change to the on-chain ledger rules.  Reversion is only possible in extreme circumstances, using the disaster recovery process that is described in [CIP-0135](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/blob/master/CIP-0135/README.md).",
          "motivation": "Protocol Version 10 enables the remainder of the CIP-1694 functionality, ensuring that DReps can participate in voting on all governance actions.  It enables treasury withdrawals, the ability to record a new constitution, updates to the constitutional committee, and votes of no confidence.  These are in addition to the 3 existing governance actions that were enabled for Protocol Version 9 by the Chang hard fork (hard forks, parameter updates, and info actions). \n\nFollowing the hard fork, the protocol will support a number of new Plutus primitives that have been defined in CIP-0122, CIP-0123 and CIP-0127.  These provide bitwise and logical operations on byte strings, plus RIPEMD-160 cryptographic hashing functionality (for compatibility with BitCoin).",

          "rationale": "Renaming the \u201cSecond Chang Hard Fork\u201d (Chang 2) to the Plomin Hard Fork, in memory of Cardano community contributor Matthew Plomin, reflects a natural progression of Cardano\u2019s governance growth. Phil Chang was an employee of Input Output who made significant contributions to Cardano\u2019s governance system to help transfer control and responsibility of the blockchain into the hands of the community. Matthew Plomin was an exemplar of the Cardano community, representing every individual who stands ready to pick up the torch and carry the ecosystem forward.\n\nMatthew was a much loved and respected member of the Cardano community. He passed unexpectedly on November 14th, 2024. Originally hailing from Indiana, USA; he earned a Bachelor of Science in Management degree from Purdue University where he met and married the love of his life, Jillian (Shaw). He went on to receive his Master of Business Administration Degree from George Washington University before joining the DWS Group (Deutsche Bank) and rising to the Head of the US Money Market Credit Research team. His expertise in the traditional finance world was instrumental in his journey to found $USDM, a Cardano-native stable coin pegged to the US Dollar and fully backed by dollar reserves.\n\nAs a Cardano community member, Matthew was always eager to learn more and excited to help others work through issues they encountered with their projects in the ecosystem. He taught himself how to mint native assets, experimenting with social games and helping Jillian to publish a book she authored in a serialized, token-based format. Seeing the need for a US Dollar-backed Stablecoin on Cardano, Matthew assembled a team that would become the Moneta project. Despite limited institutional backing during a market bottom, the community stepped up to champion him and their support helped his dream become a reality.\n\nMatthew leaves behind his wife, Jillian, their seven children, and the Moneta team. His legacy lives on through the work that he accomplished and the inspiration that he kindled in others. As a devout Roman Catholic Christian, Matthew lived out the \u201cGolden Rule\u201d to \u201cdo unto others as you would have them do unto you,\u201d and the world is a better place for him being in it.",
          "motivation": "There is a tradition of naming hard forks in memory of notable historical figures or significant contributors to the Cardano community. Naming this hard fork in memory of Matthew Plomin would memorialize his actions in life to selflessly support and contribute to the Cardano blockchain ecosystem.",

          "rationale": "We propose to update the Plutus V3 Cost Model via a Parameter Update governance action to enable the new Plutus primitives that will be available following the Chang #2 hard fork (to Protocol Version 10).  Existing Plutus cost model settings will not be changed.  Note that the new primitives will not be enabled in Protocol version 9 (as enabled by the Chang hard fork). \n\n## Technical Evaluation\n\nThe changes described in this governance action have been recommended by Intersect\u2019s Parameter Committee on 2024-10-10, as evidenced by [this post in the Cardano Forum](https://forum.cardano.org/t/oct-10-2024-voltaire-era-parameter-committee-intermediate-state/137361), and subsequently ratified unanimously by Intersect's Technical Steering Committee on 2024-10-18.\n\n\n### Functionality\n\nAs described below, 12 new Plutus v3 primitives will be enabled following the Chang#2 hard fork. These will provide new bitwise and cryptographic hashing functions that have a variety of uses, and which will enhance interoperability with BitCoin and Ethereum.  The revised Plutus v3 cost model will enable those new primitives.  The changes are all additions to the existing Plutus V3 cost model.  No changes will be made to the cost model values for any existing Plutus primitives or to the Plutus V1 and V2 cost nodels.\n### Security\n\n\nNo specific security concerns are raised by this change. A security report will be provided for the new Plutus primitives to support the Chang#2 hard fork.\n\n\n### Performance\n\nIn line with [Plutus benchmarking procedures](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/plutus/blob/master/plutus-core/cost-model/CostModelGeneration.md), [standard benchmarking has been undertaken on a reference machine](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/plutus/blob/master/plutus-core/cost-model/data/benching-conway.csv) to determine these cost model settings and to align them with existing Plutus primitives.  Since Plutus script execution times and memory usage are bounded by `maxBlockExecutionUnits[steps/memory]` and `maxTxExecutionUnits[steps/memory]`, there will be no overall performance impact on the node from these new cost model settings.\n\n### Sustainability\n\nThe upgrade provides new Plutus functionality that will enhance its bitwise and cryptographic capabilities and provide better interoperability with BitCoin and Ethereum.\n\n## New Plutus Primitives that will be Enabled after the Chang#2 Hard Fork\n\n\nThe new Plutus primitives are defined in three CIPs: [CIP-0122](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-0122), [CIP-0123](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-0123) and [CIP-0127](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-0127).\n\n### CIP-0122\nBitwise operations, both over fixed-width and variable-width blocks of bits, have a range of uses, including data structures (especially succinct ones) and cryptography. Currently, operations on individual bits in Plutus Core are difficult, or outright impossible, while also keeping within the tight constraints required on-chain. While it is possible to some degree to work with individual bytes over BuiltinByteStrings, this isn't sufficient, or efficient, when bit manipulations are required.\n\nThe new Plutus primitives defined by CIP-0122 are:\n\n- Bitwise logical AND, OR, XOR and complement;\n- Reading a bit value at a given index;\n- Setting bits value at given indices; and\n- Replicating a byte a given number of times.\n\n> ``\n> andByteString, orByteString, xorByteString, complementByteString, readBit, writeBits, replicateByte\n> ``\n\n### CIP-0123\nThe new bitwise operations that are defined in CIP-0123 extend the set that is provided by CIP-0123 to provide a usefully 'complete' set of bitwise operations.\n\nThe new Plutus primitives defined by CIP-0123 are:\n\n- Bit shifts and rotations\n- Counting the number of set bits (popcount)\n- Finding the first set bit\n\n> ``\n> shiftByteString,\n> rotateByteString,\n> countSetBits,\n> findFirstSetBit\n> ``\n\n\n### CIP-0127\nThe integration of the ECDSA and Schnorr signatures over the secp256k1 curve into Plutus was a significant step towards interoperability with the Ethereum and Bitcoin ecosystems. However, full compatibility is still impossible due to the absence of the RIPEMD-160 hashing algorithm in the Plutus interpreter. This is a fundamental component of Bitcoin's cryptographic framework.\n\nAdding RIPEMD-160 support to Plutus enhances the potential for cross-chain solutions between Cardano and Bitcoin blockchains and complements the set of primitives which are already available. It will allow for the verification of Bitcoin addresses and transactions on-chain. This addition also enables the verification of signed messages that identify the signer by the public key hash, which has not yet been witnessed on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nThe new Plutus primitive defined by CIP-0127 is:\n\n- [RIPEMD-160 hashing](https://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~bosselae/ripemd160/pdf/AB-9601/AB-9601.pdf)\n\n> ``\n> ripemd_160\n> ``\n\nEach of the new primitives has both CPU and memory unit cost models.\n\n\n## Differences to the current Plutus cost model that will be enacted by this governance action.\n\n\nThe full difference from the current on-chain Plutus V3 cost model settings is shown below.

None of these guardrails can be checked by the automated guardrails script.\n\n\n### Consistency with PCM-01\n\nThe new cost model settings have been validated by the IO Engineering Plutus Core developer team against the same reference machine and implementation as the existing mainnet Plutus cost model settings.\n\n\n### Consistency with PCM-02\n\nThe cost model has been updated because new Plutus primitives will be introduced following the upgrade to Protocol Version 10.\n\n\n### Consistency with PCM-03\n\nNone of the new cost model values is negative.\n\n\n\n\n## Reversion Plan\n\n\nThe changes can be reversed if necessary by reinstating the current set of Plutus cost model values, omitting any settings for the new primitives.\n",

          "abstract": "The K parameter was created to limit the total number of ADA staked to one pool. The K parameter determines the saturation of stakepools. To calculate the saturation of stakepools you can take the total number of ADA and divide it by K. K is currently 500, and pool saturation is currently 74,551,771.86 ADA. Pool saturate will increase slightly each epoch as more ADA is minted each epoch from staking rewards.\n\nK also has a large effect on a0. a0 is another Cardano protocol paramter that determines ADA staking rewards per epoch. a0 is currently set at .3. If a stakepool operator pledges the enough ADA to saturate their pool they earn 30% more ADA rewards per epoch. If you pledge half of the pools saturation then any delegates earn 15% more ADA rewards after SPO fees. Smaller pledges have a higher impact on staking rewards with a k parameter that's higher.",
          "rationale": "We believe that it's important to submit governance info actions to encourage community participation in Cardano's governance before larger, and potentially more serious proposals are introduced. It's also important that people have a good understanding of what protocol parameters can be changed.\n\nYou can use this official link to learn more about Cardano protocol parameters.",
          "motivation": "This governance action is by no means a suggestion of what Cardano protocol parameters should be modified to or if they should be modified at this time. The goal of this governance action is to increase governance participation before the next hardfork. You can register to be a dRep now with your own wallet, or delegate to another dRep today.",
