The following change is proposed together in this rationale, but will require two separate, linked governance actions as per guardrail MTEU-M-04.\n\n1) increase Plutus script memory unit limits per transaction by 25% to allow greater flexibility for DApp developers.\n2) increase Plutus script memory unit limits per block by 25% to remain consistent with the current block memory limits.\n\nNo other protocol parameters or Plutus cost model setting will be changed.","metadata_rationale":"Intersect's Parameter Committee proposes to update the Plutus memory unit limits (`maxTxExecutionUnits[memory]` and `maxBlockExecutionUnits[memory]`) to enable more work to be done by a Plutus script.\n\n## Technical Evaluation\n\nThe changes described in this governance action have been recommended by Intersect's Parameter Committee on [2025-05-08](https://forum.cardano.org/t/may-08-2025-parameter-committee-triweekly-meeting-notes/150392), and subsequently ratified by Intersect's Technical Steering Committee on 2025-10-01 (see via [Recording](https://youtu.be/Gd7t52uh3m0?si=FIHpflP8yxH-xWqi&t=1110) or [Minutes](https://committees.docs.intersectmbo.org/intersect-technical-steering-committee/meeting-minutes/2025-tsc-meeting-minutes/meeting-minutes-october-01-2025#decisions-actionshttps://committees.docs.intersectmbo.org/intersect-technical-steering-committee/meeting-minutes/2025-tsc-meeting-minutes/meeting-minutes-october-01-2025#decisions-actions)).\n\n### Testnet Deployments\n\nAn equivalent change was enacted on the Preview testnet within October 2025 `gov_action1d8y53n0fp34e6ltpt90g2dxpqmkygyevkpy6kf2c8xwmzfsvra5sq3c8rpt` and on the PreProd testnet within November 2025 `gov_action1zk80dvjfklp7cgvuvtg37zuwwe4r2erj6q3m67c7wdh0akth70rqq44samn`.\n\n### Functionality\n\nAs described below, the main effect of the update will be to enable more work to be done by Plutus scripts within a single block. This removes or reduces pain points for DApp developers and users.\n\n### Security\n\nNo specific security concerns are raised by this change. Performance results indicate that Praos timing guarantees will be maintained following this change.\n\n### Performance\n\nThere is no impact on overall performance or timing guarantees from increasing `maxTxExecutionUnits[memory]`. The impact on overall performance from increasing `maxBlockExecutionUnits[memory]` has been evaluated by IOE's Performance and Tracing team using node versions [10.2](https://updates.cardano.intersectmbo.org/reports/2025-03-execbudget-memory-10.2/) and [10.3](https://updates.cardano.intersectmbo.org/reports/2025-05-execbudget-memory-10.3/). These benchmarking results indicate that there is adequate headroom in critical timing metrics to allow the proposed increase.\n\n### Sustainability\n\nThe upgrade:\n\n1) reduces a pain point when building Plutus scripts (reducing the need for manual tweaking to meet per-transaction limits);\n\n2) allows more work to be done by an existing Plutus script;\n\n3) potentially allows more Plutus scripts to execute per block, if the work remains the same;\n\nThese upgrades ensure decentralized applications on Cardano can scale sustainably.\n\n## Plutus Memory Unit Changes\n\nPer-transaction and per-block Plutus memory unit limits will both be increased by the maximum recommended by the guardrails. This will ensure that the same number of maximally sized transactions (4) will fit into a single block.\n\n1) `maxTxExecutionUnits[memory]` will be increased from 14,000,000 memory units to 16,500,000 memory units (a ~17.9% increase);\n\n2) `maxBlockExecutionUnits[memory]` will be increased from 62,000,000 memory units to 72,000,000 memory units (a ~16.1% increase).\n\n### Impact of the Change to Memory Unit Limits\n\nThe Plutus memory unit settings serve to limit the total execution time that a Plutus script can take, as well as the memory usage. Measurements show that this is a more significant restriction on total Plutus execution time than `maxTxExecutionUnits[steps]` and `maxBlockExecutionUnits[steps]`. The limits have been increased historically, but were restricted by the need to adhere to Praos security guarantees. New benchmarking results following improvements to the Plutus interpreter and elsewhere indicate that there is now sufficient headroom to increase these limits.\n\n### Subsequent Changes\n\nThis governance action represents the first part of a proposed two-step increase of 25% to both `maxTxExecutionUnits[memory]` and `maxBlockExecutionUnits[memory]`. A subsequent governance action will propose to increase `maxTxExecutionUnits[memory]` to 17,500,000 units and `maxBlockExecutionUnits[memory]` to 77,500,000 units. To comply with the current guardrails, that governance action would need to be enacted no less than 2 epochs after the enactment of this governance action.\n\n## Consistency with Guardrails\n\nThe relevant guardrails in the [Cardano Constitution](https://cardano.org/constitution/) are:\n\n- **PARAM-03a**: Critical protocol parameters require an SPO vote in addition to a DRep vote: SPOs must say \"yes\" with a collective support of more than 50% of all active block production stake. This is enforced by the Guardrails on the stake pool voting threshold.\n\n- **PARAM-04a**: At least 3 months should normally pass between the publication of an off-chain proposal to change a critical protocol parameter and the submission of the corresponding on-chain governance action. This Guardrail may be relaxed in the event of a Severity 1 or Severity 2 network issue following careful technical discussion and evaluation.\n\n- **NETWORK-01**: No individual network parameter should change more than once per two epochs.\n\n- **NETWORK-02**: Only one network parameter should be changed per epoch unless they are directly correlated, e.g., per-transaction and per-block memory unit limits.\n\n- **MTEU-M-01**: `maxTxExecutionUnits[memory]` must not exceed 40,000,000 units\n\n- **MTEU-M-02**: `maxTxExecutionUnits[memory]` must not be negative\n\n- **MTEU-M-03**: `maxTxExecutionUnits[memory]` must not be decreased\n\n- **MTEU-M-04**: `maxTxExecutionUnits[memory]` should not be increased by more than 2,500,000 units in any epoch\n\n- **MBEU-M-01**: `maxBlockExecutionUnits[memory]` must not exceed 120,000,000 units\n\n- **MBEU-M-02**: `maxBlockExecutionUnits[memory]` must not be negative\n\n- **MBEU-M-03**: `maxBlockExecutionUnits[memory]` should not be changed (increased or decreased) by more than 10,000,000 units in any epoch\n\n- **MBEU-M-04a**: The impact of any change to maxBlockExecutionUnits[memory] must be confirmed by detailed benchmarking/simulation and not exceed the requirements of the block diffusion/propagation time budgets, as also impacted by `maxBlockExecutionUnits[steps]` and `maxBlockBodySize`. Any increase must also consider previously agreed future requirements for the total block size (`maxBlockBodySize`) measured against the total block diffusion target of 3s with 95% block propagation within 5s. Future Plutus performance improvements may allow the per-block memory limit to be increased, but must be balanced against the overall diffusion limits as specified in the previous sentence, and future requirements\n\n- **MEU-M-01**: `maxBlockExecutionUnits[memory]` must not be less than `maxTxExecutionUnits[memory]`\n\n- **PCM-01:** Cost model values must be set by benchmarking on a reference architecture\n\n- **PCM-02:** The cost model must be updated if new primitives are introduced or a new Plutus language version is added\n\n- **PCM-03:** Cost model values should not be negative\n\nThis governance action is consistent with all these guardrails. PARAM-03a, MTEU-M-01, MTEU-M-02, MBEU-M-01, and MBEU-M-02 can be checked by the automated guardrails script.\n\n### Consistency with PARAM-03a\n\n`maxBlockExecutionUnits[memory]` is a critical system parameter. The ledger rules require an SPO vote to change this setting; the corresponding SPO voting threshold then automatically enforces the voting requirement.\n\n### Consistency with PARAM-04a\n\n`maxBlockExecutionUnits[memory]` is a critical system parameter. It does not relate to a Severity 1 or Severity 2 network issue, so the guardrail cannot be relaxed. The [original proposal \"PCP003\"](https://forum.cardano.org/t/pcp-003-max-tx-ex-mem-pilanningham/125506/26) was [discussed](https://forum.cardano.org/c/governance/parameters-committee-updates/220) throughout the year in the open Parameter Committee Tri-Weekly and the intent to propose the change on-chain was specifically [published off-chain](https://forum.cardano.org/t/intention-to-changeplutus-script-memory-unit-limits-maxtxexecutionunits-memory-and-maxblockexecutionunits-memory/147270) on 2025-07-07 as per the guardrail's requirement of a 3 month notice period.\n\n### Consistency with NETWORK-01\n\nThe previous linked parameter update did not change either `maxTxExecutionUnits[memory]` or `maxBlockExecutionUnits[memory]`, and was enacted more than two epochs before this update would be enacted.\n\n### Consistency with NETWORK-02\n\n`maxTxExecutionUnits[memory]` and `maxBlockExecutionUnits[memory]` are related network parameters, and are explicitly identified as such in the guardrail.\n\n### Consistency with MTEU-M-01\n\nThe proposed setting of `maxTxExecutionUnits[memory]` is less than 40,000,000 units.\n\n### Consistency with MTEU-M-02\n\nThe proposed setting of `maxTxExecutionUnits[memory]` is positive.\n\n### Consistency with MTEU-M-03\n\nThe proposed setting of `maxTxExecutionUnits[memory]` is greater than the current setting of `maxTxExecutionUnits[memory]`.\n\n### Consistency with MTEU-M-04\n\nThe proposed setting of `maxTxExecutionUnits[memory]` represents an increase of 2,500,000 units, the maximum that is recommended by the guardrail.\n\n### Consistency with MBEU-M-01\n\nThe proposed setting of `maxBlockExecutionUnits[memory]` is less than 120,000,000 units.\n\n### Consistency with MBEU-M-02\n\nThe proposed setting of `maxBlockExecutionUnits[memory]` is positive.\n\n### Consistency with MBEU-M-03\n\nThe proposed setting of `maxBlockExecutionUnits[memory]` represents an increase of 10,000,000 units, the maximum that is recommended by the guardrail.\n\n### Consistency with MBEU-M-04a\n\nBenchmarking confirms that the performance should be within the stated bounds, and that there is scope for further increases.\n\n### Consistency with MEU-M-01\n\nThe per-block limit (`maxBlockExecutionUnits[memory]`) is significantly greater than the per-transaction limit (`maxTxExecutionUnits[memory]`).\n\n## Reversion Plan\n\nThis change has minimal or no effect on overall network performance, so it is unlikely to need to be reverted. The change to `maxTxExecutionUnits[memory]` could be reverted, if necessary, to its current setting. However, the change can only sensibly be reversed if no transactions or scripts have taken advantage of it: reverting `maxTxExecutionUnits[memory]` to its present setting would cause disruption to any DApp developers and users that have exploited it, requiring them to rewrite or reconfigure their Plutus scripts.

This governance action serves as an opportunity for all governance stakeholders to formally express their positions regarding the proposed Net Change Limit, ensuring transparency, accountability, and alignment across the ecosystem.\n\nThe Net Change Limit will begin at the start of **Epoch 613** (13 February 2026) and conclude at the end of **Epoch 713** (3 July 2027). The Net Change Limit will be **350,000,000,000,000 lovelace** (350M ada). Unless superseded by a new NCL, this is the maximum amount that can be withdrawn from the treasury during this specific period and shall not be exceeded.\n\nThe Net Change Limit will be used when reviewing treasury withdrawal actions to ensure constitutionality as required by Article IV of the Cardano Constitution and the Treasury Withdrawal Guardrails outlined in Appendix I.\n\nThis action has been submitted on the behalf of the Cardano Budget Committee at Intersect, following community feedback.","metadata_rationale":"### Period and Amount\n\nThe Net Change Limit (NCL) shall begin at the start of **Epoch 613** (13 February 2026) and conclude at the end of **Epoch 713** (3 July 2027).\n\nThe Net Change Limit shall be set at **350,000,000,000,000 lovelace** (350 million ada).\n\nAn approximately **16-month 20 day NCL period** is proposed to realign the NCL cycle with the mid-year budget season rather than year-end holidays, aiming to improve governance participation and downstream ecosystem impact. This timing also ensures that, when setting the subsequent NCL, a fully completed prior year of treasury inflow data is available, enabling more accurate modeling and clearer justification.\n\n### Calculation and Methodology\n\nNet Income for 2025 is defined as the sum of treasury inflows from **Epoch 532** through **Epoch 604**. These inflows totaled **306,940,195 ada**.\n\nTo recognize existing approved budgets, the withdrawal limit is set at **350 million ada**, representing approximately **115%** of the realized Net Income. This elevated cap was primarily driven by the inclusion of the 2025 Stablecoin DeFi Liquidity Budget (Gov Action ID: gov_action1u4jrcvlkppjzuv5j9z5ksacwtvv77h6glu0knpcjut8gvjjfu0cqqt3alsy).\n\nAlthough DReps approved this **50 million ada** allocation, the proposers have not requested the funds via a treasury withdrawal/s at time of this NCL submission. However, to respect the will of the DReps and their demonstrated willingness to fund this initiative in 2025, we deemed it responsible to incorporate this approved amount into our NCL projection. Consequently, the current financial projection reflects both the inclusion of this 2025 budget and an evaluation of the anticipated development load for 2026.\n\n### Application and Compliance\n\nThis limit shall be applied in assessing **treasury withdrawal actions** to ensure compliance with Article IV of the Cardano Constitution and the Treasury Withdrawal Guardrails specified in Appendix I.\n\n### Voting and Thresholds\n\nA vote in favor of this proposal indicates agreement with the proposed Net Change Limit, allowing for the submission of treasury withdrawal governance actions. However, the maximum amount that can be withdrawn from the treasury during this specific period shall not exceed the total sum outlined herein.\n\nPer the Cardano Constitution, the approval of a Net Change Limit requires a threshold of **greater than 50%** of the active voting DRep stake. Therefore, this Net Change Limit will be considered passed if, at the time the governance action expires, the DRep **YES** votes represent **more than 50%** of the active voting stake. While not obligated, Constitutional Committee members are encouraged to provide their opinion via a rationale on this Net Change Limit.","metadata_motivation":"Prior to the submission of any treasury withdrawal, a Net Change Limit must be formally agreed upon by delegated representatives (Article IV Section 3 of the Constitution). Failure to establish a Net Change Limit shall render any such treasury withdrawal action unconstitutional and, therefore, inapplicable.\n\nThe Net Change Limit will be effective for the period specified in this action.","metadata_references":"[{\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Treasury Inflows in 2025\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafkreia3aviaid224ntcujdy4amfg66rtk22d5nkc7kiysfkuhrfdwy2ji\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Data Model\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafkreihoyhfdt4eimzmsxjpchghtutzeglp76f4mnxrfcffi3ehwahgqfm\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Cardano Constitution\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafkreiazhhawe7sjwuthcfgl3mmv2swec7sukvclu3oli7qdyz4uhhuvmy\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Definitions for the Cardano Constitution\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafkreiewp5bgrdiesq6ft3qypykgcjhvfgpp4s5o4yrjrvko4wuhi4iecu\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Ratification Methodology\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafkreid73y3piatznscr4g2kvyf2cefmedtpurgcad6nnfhqnvlzkbmuei\"}]","metadata_resolved":1,"metadata_hash_valid":1,"proposer_address":"","param_changes":null,"treasury_amount_lovelace":null,"treasury_recipients":null,"flags":"[{\"flag\": \"\\ud83d\\udfe1 NO_DISCUSSION\", \"severity\": \"yellow\", \"score\": 3, \"detail\": \"No links to forum discussion or community feedback\"}]","flag_score":3,"first_seen":"2026-02-09T18:50:25.950966+00:00","last_updated":"2026-02-09T22:00:01.543836+00:00"},

DeltaDeFi directly contributes to 5 of them:\n\n| Vision 2030 KPI | Current | 2030 Target | DeltaDeFi 6-Mo Target | Contribution |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| **TVL** | $200M | $3B | $10M | 0.33% |\n| **MAU** | 100-300k | 1M | 1,000 traders | 0.10% |\n| **Monthly Transactions** | 800k | 27M | 5,000 L1 settlements | 0.02% (L1) |\n| **Protocol Revenue** | 3.5M ADA | ≥16M ADA | ~10k ADA/yr | 0.06% |\n| **Throughput Capacity** | 300k/day | 3x current | 1M L2 tx/month | **5.56%** |\n\n**KPIs Not Addressed:** Uptime (99.98%), Voting Power Distribution, Alternative Node Clients, DRep Participation.\n\n### Throughput Contribution Analysis\n\nThe **Throughput Capacity** KPI is DeltaDeFi's strongest contribution. Based on Cardano's L1 theoretical maximum of 46.7M tx/month ([Chainspect](https://chainspect.app/chain/cardano): 18.02 TPS), the 3x target requires closing an 18M tx/month gap. DeltaDeFi's 1M L2 transactions per month represents **5.56%** of this gap via L2 scaling.\n\nThis aligns with Vision 2030's L2 integration strategy: \"high-volume activity can move off L1 and settle back.\" DeltaDeFi demonstrates a **200:1 L2-to-L1 efficiency ratio** (1M L2 transactions settled via 5,000 L1 transactions).\n\n### Budget Efficiency vs KPI Contribution\n\n| Metric | Value |\n| :---: | :---: |\n| Budget Requested | ₳1.5M |\n| Estimated 5-Year Treasury | ₳1,000M (200M NCL × 5) |\n| **Budget Utilization** | **0.15%** |\n\n**Weighted KPI Contribution** (equal weight across 9 KPIs):\n\n| KPI | Contribution | Weight (1/9) | Weighted |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| TVL | 0.33% | 11.1% | 0.037% |\n| MAU | 0.10% | 11.1% | 0.011% |\n| Monthly Txs | 0.02% | 11.1% | 0.002% |\n| Protocol Revenue | 0.06% | 11.1% | 0.007% |\n| Throughput | 5.56% | 11.1% | 0.618% |\n| 4 KPIs (not addressed) | 0% | 44.4% | 0% |\n| **Total** |   |   | **0.68%** |\n\n| Input | Output | Efficiency |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| 0.15% of treasury | 0.68% weighted KPI contribution | **4.5x ROI** |\n\n# Constitutionality Checklist (Info Action scope)\n\n* **Purpose**\n  * This proposal is for work intended to enhance the **liquidity, usability and long-term sustainability** of Cardano by providing Hydra-based trading infrastructure and transparent trading-quality metrics. It fits within **Article IV.1** as a budget for the future development of the ecosystem.\n* **Article III.5 – On-chain governance process**\n  * The proposal will be submitted in a clear, standard format with:\n  * Title, abstract, motivation and rationale; and\n  * A URL and content hash for this off-chain document.\n* **Info Action nature**\n  * This is a **Budget Info Action**, not a Treasury Withdrawal:\n  * It **does not move any ADA** from the Treasury; and\n  * It records DRep and community sentiment on whether a **₳1,500,000, 6-month budget** for DeltaDeFi Hydra trading infrastructure and market-quality metrics is desirable in principle.\n* **Article IV – Budgets and Treasury Withdrawals (future work)**\n  * Any subsequent Treasury Withdrawal GA based on this Info Action will:\n  * Respect the **Net Change Limit (NCL)** in effect at the time (amount and timing);\n  * Specify an administrator and administration model in line with **Article IV.2**;\n  * Make explicit provision for **an independent auditor and audit process** in line with Article IV.4 (including dedicated budget and reporting expectations).\n  * Ensure funds are held in **segregated, auto-abstain-delegated addresses** while under administration.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThis Budget Info Action asks whether the Cardano community supports dedicating **₳1,500,000 over 6 months** to:\n\n* Harden and scale **DeltaDeFi** into a production-grade Hydra trading venue for ADA and key CNT pairs; and\n* Deliver a **Vision 2030 KPI Measurement Programme** with baseline report, public dashboard, and progress report tracking DeFi infrastructure contribution to ecosystem goals.\n\nThe intent is not to fund a niche application, but to strengthen **Cardano's core trading infrastructure** in alignment with **Vision 2030's DeFi vertical** (\"institutional-grade liquidity and usable DeFi\") and provide measurable data on progress toward ecosystem KPIs.\n\nVoters are not yet asked to approve any withdrawals. They are asked to signal whether this direction — **supporting Hydra-based trading infrastructure and Vision 2030-aligned KPI measurement** — is a good use of Treasury budgeting for the next 6 months.","metadata_motivation":"## Why this matters for Cardano, ADA and CNT holders\n\nCardano currently lacks a **low-latency order-book venue** that can:\n\n* Support **API-driven trading, arbitrage and market-making** at scale;\n* Offer **tight spreads and low slippage** in key ADA–stable and ADA–CNT markets; and\n* Provide a clear, measurable picture of how competitive Cardano is as an L1 for trading compared with other ecosystems and CEXs.\n\nToday, most Cardano trading happens on AMM-style DEXs. They are great for simple swaps, but they are not optimised for:\n\n* **Low-fee, low-slippage execution at size** in core ADA and CNT pairs;\n* **Instant, predictable fills** for API and bot-driven strategies; or\n* **Professional market-makers and arbitrageurs** who expect CEX-like order-book behaviour.\n\nDeltaDeFi is designed to fill this gap: a **Hydra-based, low-latency order-book** with **tight spreads, fast matching** and **first-class API support**, so that ADA and CNT liquidity can be deployed efficiently and Cardano can compete more directly with order-book venues on other chains and on CEXs.\n\nA performant, observable exchange is therefore not just another dApp, but part of Cardano’s **core infrastructure**. It supports the Constitution’s emphasis on **future development of the ecosystem** by making Cardano a more attractive base layer for capital, traders, and applications built around ADA and CNTs.\n\n## Why Hydra and why DeltaDeFi\n\nHydra offers the latency and UX profile needed for modern trading but is still under-represented in production-grade, user-facing protocols. DeltaDeFi is:\n\n* A **Hydra-based, low-latency order-book DEX** already live in beta on mainnet;\n* Built by a team with an existing track record in:\n  * high-frequency trading tooling,\n  * Cardano SDKs and infrastructure, and\n  * Project Catalyst delivery; and\n* Focused on **spot trading and API-driven participants**, where reliable execution and transparent metrics matter most.\n\nEarlier Project Catalyst funding helped bootstrap the current codebase and beta deployment with relatively modest budgets. This proposal is intended to take that work from \"working beta\" to **robust, measurable infrastructure** for the whole ecosystem.\n\n## Team Background\n\nDeltaDeFi is built by the same team behind **SIDAN Lab**, with a multi-year track record in the Cardano ecosystem:\n\n* **MeshJS Core Maintainers**: The team maintains [MeshJS](https://meshjs.dev), the largest TypeScript SDK in the Cardano ecosystem, used by numerous dApps and developers for wallet integration, transaction building, and smart contract interaction.\n* **Stake Pool Operators & DReps**: Single SPO (SIDAN) since 2021 and an active DRep in Cardano governance.\n* **Cardano Hong Kong Community**: Active contributors to the Cardano HK community, organizing meetups, workshops, and developer education initiatives.\n* **Open Source Commitment**: Consistent delivery of open-source tooling and infrastructure, with MeshJS serving as critical developer infrastructure across the ecosystem.\n* **Extensive open source footprint** - 47 public repositories on [GitHub](https://github.com/sidan-lab) including multi-language Cardano SDKs: Whisky (Rust), Vodka (Aiken), Rum (Go), and Gin (Python), all Apache-2.0 licensed\n* **Project Catalyst Track Record**: Multiple successfully delivered Catalyst projects spanning SDK development, developer tooling, and infrastructure.\n\nThis background in developer tooling and infrastructure directly informs DeltaDeFi's approach: building robust, well-documented, API-first trading infrastructure that other projects can integrate with.\n\n## Direct relevance to ADA and CNT holders\n\nFrom the point of view of ADA and CNT holders, the key questions are:\n\n* **How expensive is it to move size on Cardano?**\n  Slippage plus fees for 1k / 10k / 100k ADA trades in core pairs such as ADA/USDM.\n\n* **How well aligned are ADA and major CNT prices across DEXs and with CEX prices?**\n  Price gaps between on-chain venues and a simple CEX reference.\n\n* **How fragmented and inconsistent are CNT markets across Cardano DEXs?**\n  Differences in price, depth and execution quality for the same tokens on different venues.\n\nToday, answering these questions requires stitching together multiple tools and APIs. As part of this budget, DeltaDeFi will:\n\n* Deliver **tighter, deeper markets** on at least one Hydra-based venue; and\n* Publish a **Vision 2030 KPI dashboard** so ADA and CNT holders can track, in numbers, whether Cardano is progressing toward its DeFi vertical goals.","metadata_references":"[{\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Off-chain document\", \"uri\": \"https://hackmd.io/@DeltaDeFi/budget-draft,\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Cardano 2030: Vision, Mission, Strategy Framework and KPIs\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafkreifxxz6n33l5umvgxdoxzp35gsnbzvi63slmeqnwg3pj4gsrwnzr4e\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Cardano Constitution\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafkreiazhhawe7sjwuthcfgl3mmv2swec7sukvclu3oli7qdyz4uhhuvmy\"}]","metadata_resolved":1,"metadata_hash_valid":1,"proposer_address":"","param_changes":null,"treasury_amount_lovelace":null,"treasury_recipients":null,"flags":"[{\"flag\": \"\\ud83d\\udfe1 NO_DISCUSSION\", \"severity\": \"yellow\", \"score\": 3, \"detail\": \"No links to forum discussion or community feedback\"}]","flag_score":3,"first_seen":"2026-02-09T18:50:25.950966+00:00","last_updated":"2026-02-09T22:00:01.543836+00:00"},

Section 7 (CC tool support)\n\nEncouragement: ARTICLE VI. Section 3 (SPO code of conduct), ARTICLE VIII. Section 1 (constitutional discussion)\n\nRationale: These provisions were aspirational or advisory in nature (expectations/encouragements), not enforceable constitutional rules.\n\n### (b) Budget Info Action Provisions (ARTICLE III. Section 4, ARTICLE IV, ARTICLE VII. Section 4)\n\nRationale: The Budget Info Action mechanism was removed to simplify governance. Its requirements have been absorbed into Treasury Withdrawal Governance Actions.\n\n### \\(c\\) Obligation to Create a CC Code of Conduct (ARTICLE VII.

Changes and additions (excluding deletions)\n\n### (a) Overall - Fixed typos, simplified wording, and unified terminology.\n\nRationale: Improves readability and ensures consistency\n\n### (b) Defined Terms: - Added definitions such as Active Voting Stake,  DRep, SPO, Net Change Limit, Treasury Withdrawal Recipient.\n\nRationale: Eliminates ambiguity and ensures consistency in interpretation\n\n### \\(c\\) ARTICLE II, Section 6 – Introduced requirement that “The document hosted by such a URL shall be immutable.”\n\nRationale: Ensure proposals cannot be altered after submission, protecting integrity and trust\n\n### (d) ARTICLE II Section 7 :Reassigned conditions previously tied to the Budget Info Action, making them mandatory at the time of Treasury Withdrawals after its removal\n\nRationale: Strengthen accountability and transparency in the use of Treasury funds and preserve oversight and audit safeguards after removing the Budget Info Action mechanism\n\n# II. Summary of Changes and Rationale (v2.3 → v2.4)\n\nEMURGO expressed concerns regarding three specific wording changes introduced in Constitution v2.3 and voted NO on its adoption.\nSince EMURGO is the largest DRep, and changing the Constitution without its consent would be highly impractical, these three modifications are reverted to the wording used in the original Constitution (v1.0).\n\n1. Change \"Ada Holder\" to \"ada owner\" and remove this definition.\n\n2. Revert the wording of provisions related to custodians to the form used in v1.0.\n\n3.

The proposed vision and Strategy are aiming to offer that.\n\nAll the elements of this proposal, Vision, Mission, Strategy framework and KPIs, are not intended to remain fixed forever, but rather be **a starting point** to constantly review as new data become available and improve to remain relevant. The process followed to reach this point is documented and repeatable, but any other comparable process supported by data and community consultation will provide a strong foundation for future updates via info actions.\n\n### Vision Breakdown\n\n*Cardano is the most secure, reliable and censorship-resistant blockchain for mission critical applications to power economies and societies of the future.*\n\n“*Most secure, reliable and censorship-resistant*” refers to the current qualities Cardano has achieved through its infrastructure, 99% uptime and decentralized structure.  \n“*For mission critical applications*” refers to those applications (AKA potential clients) that would require “*secure, reliable and censorship-resistant*” infrastructure for their use cases. “*To power economies and societies of the future*” refers to the broader goal these applications (clients) have.\n\n### Mission Breakdown\n\n*To empower a global ecosystem of builders, businesses, organizations, governments and communities by providing a scalable, secure, and research-based platform that enables the creation of transparent and fair digital economies.*\n\n*“To empower a global ecosystem of builders, businesses, organizations, governments and communities”*  refers to the foundational layer we provide and who are the key groups that we see will benefit from it*. “by providing a scalable, secure, and research-based platform that enables the creation of transparent and fair digital economies.”* connects to the offering covered in the vision.\n\n### Strategy Framework overview\n\nRead the full Strategy Framework [here](https://product.cardano.intersectmbo.org/vision/strategy-2030)\n\n* **Pillar 1**: Infrastructure & Research Excellence  \n  Keep Cardano secure, fast, and interoperable so it can host more economic activity.  \n* **Pillar 2**: Adoption & Utility  \n  Driving widespread, non-speculative utility by focusing on high-value industry verticals, superior user experience (UX), and enterprise-grade security.  \n* **Pillar 3**: Governance  \n  Cardano governance must be hard to capture, easy to use, and paced. This builds directly on Cardano’s tripartite model of DReps, Constitutional Committee, and SPOs.  \n* **Pillar 4**: Community & Ecosystem Growth  \n  Driving global engagement through a market-centric approach, cultivating a skilled developer base, and proactively demonstrating ecosystem value.  \n* **Pillar 5**: Ecosystem Sustainability & Resilience  \n  Ensuring the long-term financial health and operational integrity of the network infrastructure.\n\nThe **current proposed KPIs** aim to cover the minimum high level required to both track progress and to show ecosystem status externally. As the Product Committee, as well as other community members in the ecosystem, collect more data we will submit the following info actions to refine and incorporate these. (See full proposed KPIs [here](https://product.cardano.intersectmbo.org/vision/strategy-2030#core-key-performance-indicators-kpis))\n\n### Constitutionality checklist\n\nThis proposal does not require per se Constitutional Committee approval. However, as it is intended to support what is already expressed in the Cardano Constitution and, if approved, to provide a shared direction for the broader community, we encourage and welcome the current Constitutional Committee to review and, if they see fit, support this info action.\n\n### Why you should support this proposal\n\nSupporting the Cardano 2030 Vision and Strategy is essential because it provides **DReps** with a crucial **strategic measuring stick** for effective governance and treasury resource allocation. This document, which includes five Strategic Pillars and associated KPIs, gives DReps a community-vetted filter to rigorously evaluate funding requests and initiatives. It enables them to ask: *Does this proposal advance Cardano toward its 2030 Vision of being the most secure, reliable, and censorship-resistant blockchain for mission-critical applications?* **Crucially, this framework is designed to inform voting, not enforce it.** The Vision is a strategic document, not a constitutional one; it provides a shared direction to channel collective effort, but it **does not compel DReps to vote in a specific manner** and **has no bearing on the constitutionality of any future proposal or action**. By adopting this vision, the community gains the strategic discipline to focus resources and accelerate coherent, long-term growth.\n\nWe invite DReps and SPOs to attach metadata with rationale and feedback to their votes on this action.","metadata_motivation":"### Why a Defined Vision Matters Now More Than Ever\n\nIn the rapidly evolving blockchain landscape, a clear and articulated vision is no longer a luxury, but a necessity. For Cardano, establishing a forward-looking Vision 2030 is crucial to ensure sustained growth, focused innovation, and broad legitimacy.\n\n* **Infra-first limits:** Technical robustness alone does not attract developers or users; without direction, ecosystems fragment and stagnate.  \n* **Clarifying Cardano’s purpose:** Cardano must clearly articulate why it exists and what unique problems it solves to stand out among capable competitors.  \n* **Strategy beyond features:** Past roadmaps focused on *how* to build, not *why*. A vision ties technical progress to real-world users, markets, and outcomes  \n* **Measuring stick:** An established Strategy with KPIs gives DReps a measuring stick they can use to evaluate proposals against.\n\n### The Risks of Operating Without a Unified Vision\n\nLack of a shared long-term vision exposes Cardano to major strategic risks:\n\n* **Misallocation of resources:** Talent, treasury, and community energy scatter across low-impact efforts.  \n* **Hijacked narratives:** Hype cycles and trends can unintentionally steer the ecosystem without intentional Strategy.  \n* **Loss of differentiation:** Without clear strengths, Cardano becomes interchangeable with other L1s.  \n* **Outpaced by focused rivals:** Competitors that target specific niches with clear intent can outperform broad, unfocused ecosystems.\n\n### The Strategic Investment in Clarity\n\nBuilding a strong vision requires deliberate choices—and trade-offs:\n\n* **Prioritization means exclusion:** A meaningful vision must guide DReps to choose who and what Cardano serves best.  \n* **Focus requires trade-offs:** Differentiation makes Cardano highly suited for some use cases and less for others.  \n* **Alignment requires discipline:** Saying “no” to initiatives that don’t support the vision strengthens execution and coherence.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nA shared, well-defined vision is foundational to Cardano’s next decade. It guides development, reduces strategic risk, optimizes resource use, and unifies the ecosystem around meaningful, measurable impact. This first version of Cardano 2030 proposal is essential to ensuring Cardano’s continued relevance, differentiation, and long-term leadership.","metadata_references":"[{\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Vision and Mission (PDF)\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafkreicu4r3rowukvtrxaok3xd7bxkoig6uxmxgldjpyt6shjli5vjwhxe\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Vision and Mission (Markdown)\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafkreigvrlerhlh5a3ushxoldp4rplhek2ew2hk5qih6gymozmsxybqgce\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Strategy Framework and KPIs (PDF)\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafkreiewgqs6c25nk7gtzlf5udrqumpiqnbxhix7tu4yvssr2lgxgs3k2m\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Strategy Framework and KPIs (Markdown)\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafkreiaodc3h2wcvzwputnpsl5yildfgj7jc776aomkkjaiedeqrvqifxm\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Live version of Vision and Mission\", \"uri\": \"https://product.cardano.intersectmbo.org/vision/vision-2030\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Live version of Strategy Framework and KPIs\", \"uri\": \"https://product.cardano.intersectmbo.org/vision/strategy-2030\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Translations for this action\", \"uri\": \"https://productcommittee.docs.intersectmbo.org/committee-outcomes/2030-long-term-cardano-vision/cardano-2030-info-action/cardano-2030-info-action-translations\"}]","metadata_resolved":1,"metadata_hash_valid":1,"proposer_address":"","param_changes":null,"treasury_amount_lovelace":null,"treasury_recipients":null,"flags":"[]","flag_score":0,"first_seen":"2026-02-09T18:50:25.950966+00:00","last_updated":"2026-02-09T22:00:01.543836+00:00"},

Deploying initial on-chain governance features to Cardano and ushering in an interim (or technical bootstrap phase) for Cardano governance. This instated an interim Constitutional Committee, including the founding entities, three community consortiums and Intersect for an 74 epoch term (~1 year).\n\nThe second upgrade, known as Plomin, moved governance out of the interim and technical bootstrap phase into full minimum viable on-chain governance as described in [CIP-1694 | A First Step Towards On-Chain Decentralized Governance](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/blob/master/CIP-1694/README.md).\n\n### Replacing the Interim Constitutional Committee\n\nWith the interim Constitutional Committee term nearing an end, Intersect hosted an election process from May 5th to July 6th, 2025. This process intended to transition  the interim Constitutional Committee into full community control, electing seven members.\n\nDReps and stake pool operators ratified and enacted the Constitutional Committee on-chain via an Update Committee action [gov_action1g7sw….pyyt](https://cardanoscan.io/govAction/gov_action1g7sw0f8e8qa34lppj2erksvzf4j6e9udwaq6efslc8apdqeazygsq2spyyt).\n\n### Constitutional Committee Member Retiring\n\nDuring epoch 597, a Constitutional Committee member - Cardano Atlantic Council resigned from the Committee, before the end of their current term.

Only governance actions not requiring Constitutional Committee ratification are able to pass, namely Update Committee/Threshold, Info Actions*, and Motion of no-confidence.\n\nElecting a new committee member is essential to ensure the seamless continuation of Cardano governance.\n\n**Budgets and Net Change Limits are Info Actions, but these do require Constitutional Committee consideration.*","metadata_references":"[{\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Audited election Results\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafkreiajs2ntt7jjbdnrs7gcavb54c6jla7ptyaxnstg4br5covqn7y6x4\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Audit File #1 - Ekklesia results\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafkreibf7iijzmunbz6dogxdrn532pua6owwkk46t35emslolqrhcoky6a\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Audit File #2 - Ekklesia results with signatures\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafkreiauybk5bty6n2hr277mbl6hep72ini7wpjso45b6gqs5xey76beau\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Audit File #3 - Sample script to verify Merkle hash\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafkreibwl3itfcyotyuvvyhxwotn5tro576tcmol6kvosxficq5aylw6w4  \"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"The Cardano Atlantic Council Retirement Transaction (cardanoscan)\", \"uri\": \"https://cardanoscan.io/transaction/7e9e3621aa95b51f90117ddde998e67a38f98b169f42cb12a2b7134bf089cc59\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Cardano Atlantic Council Retirement Announcement\", \"uri\": \"https://x.com/CardanoAtlantic/status/1993482209353924852?t=crGTZpgdgS2AwAXrAXG9dw&s=19\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Cardano Atlantic Council Retirement on-chain metadata\", \"uri\": \"https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmfY4Nwea4nmuuRdA2APrtoDNJQhaVVkfRkkZoueZgWcaZ\"}]","metadata_resolved":1,"metadata_hash_valid":1,"proposer_address":"","param_changes":null,"treasury_amount_lovelace":null,"treasury_recipients":null,"flags":"[{\"flag\": \"\\ud83d\\udfe1 NO_DISCUSSION\", \"severity\": \"yellow\", \"score\": 3, \"detail\": \"No links to forum discussion or community feedback\"}]","flag_score":3,"first_seen":"2026-02-09T18:50:25.950966+00:00","last_updated":"2026-02-09T22:00:01.543836+00:00"},

This governance action  requests to withdraw ₳70,000,000 from the Cardano Treasury to establish a strategic integration fund supporting the onboarding of critical infrastructure, including tier-one stablecoins, institutional digital asset custody and wallet infrastructures, on-chain analytics platforms, cross-chain bridges, and pricing oracles to the Cardano ecosystem.\n\nThese integrations are foundational for tier-one stablecoin deployment, large scale DeFi growth, and acceleration of RWA and DePin activity, strengthening Cardano’s long term fee generation and treasury sustainability. This project is being driven through close collaboration between Input | Output Global, the Cardano Foundation, and EMURGO, together with Midnight Foundation and Intersect, all of whom are actively engaged in negotiations with integration partners. Representatives from all five organizations form the Steering Committee, which is responsible for all executive decisions over how these funds will be committed and spent. Multiple partners are already at an executable stage, but with sensitive commercial negotiations underway, vendor identities and line item costs remain confidential. Vendor identities can only be disclosed once integrations are completed.\n\nFunds will be administered by Intersect under a performance and milestone-based structure over a period of up to 24 months. Drawdowns occur only after signed integration partnership agreements are submitted and verified. The Oversight Committee, a group of five independent entities within Intersect's budget administration framework, will review each drawdown or disbursal to confirm alignment between scope, amounts, and recipients. Deployment is expected to begin shortly after enactment of this withdrawal.","metadata_rationale":"The Cardano Critical Integrations Budget will use the requested ₳70,000,000 to cover:\n\n**• Integration and other necessary associated costs**  \nCover the integration work and all related expenses, including deployment development, licensing fees, maintenance costs, and any additional infrastructure required to support the integrations.\n\n**• Legal and Audit**  \nCover due diligence, legal, insurance, and compliance requirements, and periodic independent audits to satisfy the requirements of the Cardano Constitution.\n\n**• Contingency Reserve**  \nMaintain a reserve to accommodate scope adjustments or market shifts, while preserving delivery certainty and financial discipline.\n\n**• Admin Fees**  \nCover custody fees, minting fees of stablecoins, and any other administrative costs that may arise during setup and execution of the Cardano Critical Integrations Budget.\n\n₳70,000,000 reflects the estimated remaining capacity under the 2025 Net Change Limit and is based on consolidated cost estimates across the priority integration pipeline. This level of funding provides sufficient runway to secure high impact integrations as they become executable, allowing the Steering Committee to move quickly and support multi-year commercial terms where required.\n\n### High-level budget breakdown\n\nAs stated in the corresponding Budget Info Action, confidentiality obligations applied by most integration partners limit the level of detail that can be publicly disclosed. For that reason, this breakdown is presented on a high level, roughly estimated basis and does not include vendor specific line items. The Steering Committee is being entrusted with all executive decisions on how to use these funds to advance the interests of the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem and unused funds at the end of the 24 month period will be returned to the Cardano Treasury.\n\nWe acknowledge DReps feedback on the budget breakdown and we recognize the balance the community expects between transparency and the commercial realities of negotiations. In complex, multi party technical integrations, contracting and delivery naturally take time, and partners often require confidentiality while agreements are being finalized. Most business contracts include confidentiality terms, and it's common for these terms to specifically mention and protect sensitive deal-related information like costs, as well as other financial data, strategies, and proprietary information. These provisions, often in the form of a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) or a clause within a larger contract, are essential for protecting a company's competitive edge. We take those obligations seriously, because honoring them is essential to securing and maintaining these relationships for the ecosystem.\n\nWithin those limits, we will share as much as partner agreements allow. This includes:  \n • Integration categories and high level scope  \n • Milestone completion and progress updates  \n • Aggregate spend reporting  \n • Outcomes delivered\n\nWhile some integrations will require a degree of longer-term assurance to the contracting party, exit terms are part of the negotiation and any unreasonable exclusivity or ‘lock in’ clauses will be avoided.\n\nWe anticipate that achieving our full vision may require additional funding in future governance cycles, but this initial allocation allows us to demonstrate value and action before requesting further resources. Requests for further funding will require an additional Budget Info Action, which will entail reporting to the Community of work delivered to date in order to allow the DReps to vote on the additional budget.\n\nA high-level, preliminary, budget breakdown is provided below, this may be updated in time in subsequent reporting, insofar as confidentiality obligations allow:\n\n| Category | Allocation (₳) | Allocation % | Description |\n| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |\n| **Integration costs** | 65,000,000 | 93% | It includes the full range of fees required for the integrations referenced in the Motivation section, including integration, licensing, and maintenance fees, as well as other related costs. |\n| **Legal, contract administration, and compliance costs**  | 3,500,000 | 5% | Due diligence, independent audits, and legal & compliance |\n| **Contingency Reserve** | 1,500,000  | 2% | Flexibility for scope or market shifts |\n| **Total** | **70,000,000** |  |  |\n\n### **Administration of Funds**\n\nThis treasury withdrawal is submitted by Intersect in its role as the Administrator, with endorsement and the collaboration of the Cardano Foundation, Input Output Global, and EMURGO as co-proposers. All treasury funds will be administered by Intersect as an Administrator under Cardano’s constitutional framework. All treasury funds for this initiative will be administered by Intersect under Article IV of the Constitution, using the Treasury Reserve Smart Contract Framework. Intersect acts as the Administrator for the entire budget. Contracting for integrations will be assigned by the Steering Committee based on the ‘best fit’ entity that has the required skills, stability, and capacity.\n\n#### Steering Committee Authority\n\nThe Steering Committee will negotiate commercial terms with integration partners and will include a technical assessment of feasibility and implementation requirements.\n\nAllocations from this budget will be approved by the Steering Committee. The quorum for any budget allocation to an integration will be 3/4 of all Steering Committee members. Once an integration is approved, Intersect will administer and execute the associated disbursements to the contracting entity, as defined for each integration.\n\nThe Steering Committee will publish progress reports upon achieving integration milestones\n\n## **Role of Intersect and Contractual Counterparties**\n\nIntersect will receive the funds and administer this budget. Intersect will also, in its capacity as a Constitutional Administrator, receive regular reporting and insight into budget expenditure. Upon enactment of this governance action, the funds will be received into the Treasury Reserve Smart Contract framework administered by Intersect with withdrawal data verification provided by the independent smart contract Oversight Committee made up of five members; the Cardano Foundation, NMKR, Xerberus, SundaeLabs, and Dquadrant. Cardano Foundation will abstain where appropriate should a conflict of interest arise between this role and its role in the Steering Committee.\n\nFunds from there will be disbursed according to the contracting arrangements. Disbursements will be made directly from the smart contract framework or an institutional-grade custodian to vendors, as selected by the Steering Committee. It is currently not envisioned that the smart contract framework deployed earlier this year will be fully utilized in so far as specific vendor smart contracts being established as this will likely result in disclosure of integration costs, which are typically confidential and protected by non-disclosure agreements. For the sake of completeness and as mentioned previously, the main Treasury Reserve Smart Contract will be the recipient address for this withdrawal, which remains in constitutional compliance. Intersect and the co-proposers will endeavor to negotiate integration contracts that allow for as much public disclosure as reasonably possible and the Steering Committee will disclose such information in their progress reports.\n\nCo-proposers or other entities chosen by the Steering Committee from time to time may, if required, act as the contracting counterparty with an integration partner. When this occurs, Intersect and the Cardano Development Holdings will enter into a contract with the designated entity defining the scope, obligations, reporting requirements, and drawdown conditions. Under this arrangement, the designated entity receives disbursements from related smart contract/s or custodians as determined by the contract terms.\n\nIntersect will only act as a contracting counterparty when it has completed its own due diligence and satisfied its Delivery Assurance standards. If Intersect declines to act as counterparty for a specific integration, another designated entity may do so, provided that a contract is established between that designated entity, Intersect and Cardano Development Holdings for the purpose of receiving and managing budget disbursements.\n\nAll contracts established under this program will include clearly defined scope, obligations, reporting requirements, drawdown conditions, and dispute resolution provisions, in order to comply with Article IV.4 of the Constitution.\n\n## **Payment Execution and Safeguards**\n\nDisbursements will be executed through either smart contracts or institutional-grade custodians. These disbursements will follow the Statements of Work and the commercial terms approved by the Steering Committee.\n\n## **Unused funds and program conclusion**\n\nIf at the end of the 24 months period the budget has not been fully utilized, all remaining funds will be returned to the Cardano Treasury. A final reconciliation and summary will be included in the oversight reporting by Intersect, in collaboration with the Steering Committee.\n\n### **Cardano Addresses**\n\nTreasury funds will be received and held by Intersect, acting as the Constitutional Administrator,  the following address addr1xxzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6v9swzhujsjlls7dajp59u95re0qdk9vh8mumlemw89535s4ecqxj (with stake account stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr) which is publicly viewable.\n\nTo fulfil constitutional requirements, this address will be delegated to the Auto-Abstain DRep and will not be staked to any Stake Pool Operator (SPO), ensuring that the funds do not influence governance or generate staking rewards. Intersect will ensure oversight and transparency through the independent audit and access to information.\n\nThrough this arrangement, the Cardano Development Holdings administered by Intersect, maintains full custody transparency, enabling verifiable auditing and milestone tracking under Cardano’s constitutional governance framework, satisfying Articles IV(2), (4) & (5) in particular.\n\n### **Acceptance Criteria and Milestone-Based Disbursement**\n\nThe acceptance criteria will vary between vendors, but will be made public once commercial terms and contracting has been agreed between the vendor, Intersect and the Steering Committee. It is expected a “milestone zero” payment will cover the essential setup costs of this initiative, which may include converting ada into a stablecoin, stablecoin minting fees, and custody fees. Converted assets will be held in a regulated custodian. Legal costs for onboarding integration partners are also included in this early operational budget.\n\nAny conversion of ada into stablecoins or other assets will occur only as part of an approved disbursement under a Statement of Work, and only after the relevant ada has left the Administrator’s dedicated, auto abstain delegated accounts in accordance with Article IV.5.\n\nIn general, integration partners will receive funds only after verified delivery of agreed technical and operational milestones. That said, payment structures may vary deal to deal. Where a partner requires funds in advance to commence delivery, an upfront payment may be made at the point of contract signature.\n\nIntegrations requiring ongoing support may receive additional approved maintenance payments during the program period.\n\nThis disbursement structure ensures efficient execution, transparent financial management, and strict alignment with Cardano’s governance requirements.\n\n### **Reporting**\n\nIntersect and the Steering Committee will publish a bi-annual report covering:\n\n1. **Financial Summary & Treasury Reconciliation** – total funds disbursed, remaining, and audited.  \n2. **Project Progress & Milestone Review** – integration status and outcomes.  \n3. **Audit & Compliance Statement** – summary of independent audit findings.  \n4. **Ecosystem Impact Assessment** – measurable effects on Cardano adoption and interoperability.  \n5. **Governance & Future Outlook** – proposed next steps or renewal recommendations.\n\n## **Constitutionality Checklist**\n\n### **Article III.5**\n\n✔️ This proposal is prepared in a standardized and legible format and will include a URL and hash of all off-chain materials at submission. It provides a clear title, abstract, rationale, motivation, and supporting information in accordance with this article.\n\n### **Article IV.1**\n\n✔️ This proposal fits the purpose of Article IV.1 as it supports the maintenance, operation, and future development of the Cardano ecosystem through critical integrations.\n\n### **Article IV.2**\n\n✔️ This proposal specifies Intersect as the administrator and outlines transparent reporting, an oversight structure and explains where the processes are or are not administered via smart contracts (where it is not possible or beneficial). These elements meet the constitutional requirement for the use of administrators and on-chain tools where beneficial.\n\n### **Article IV.3**\n\n✔️ ”2025 Net Change Limit Extension” Info Action (gov_action169kllwhfmp488je5x5rwvufd08p8sztdcf0ghf5sp6ey2gnjdwaqql47xry) to extend the 2025 NCL is currently underway. If accepted, the NCL will remain in effect from Epoch 605 to Epoch 612, removing any ambiguity in covering this proposal’s withdrawal window and keeping the ₳70,000,000 request within the applicable NCL, thereby satisfying Article IV.3.\n\n✔️ This treasury withdrawal will be made in alignment with the relevant Budget Info Action.\n\n### **Article IV.4**\n\n✔️ This proposal allocates a budget for independent audits and includes clear oversight metrics & mechanisms such as contractual milestone-based verification, bi-yearly reporting, dispute resolution provisions (to be included in relevant legal contracts), and a defined Steering Committee. These elements satisfy the constitutional requirements for audits and oversight metrics.\n\n### **Article IV.5**\n\n✔️ All ADA withdrawn will be held by Intersect in dedicated, publicly viewable addresses that will not be delegated to any SPO and will be delegated to the Auto-Abstain voting option.\n\n### **GUARDRAILS: TREASURY 02a**\n\n✔️ This treasury withdrawal confirms that the requested ₳70,000,000 will not breach the applicable Net Change Limit for the relevant period at submission or enactment (subject to the NCL extension being approved).\n\n### **GUARDRAILS: TREASURY 03a**\n\n✔️ The requested amount in this proposal is denominated in ADA\n\n### **GUARDRAILS: TREASURY 04a**\n\n✔️ This treasury withdrawal will only be eligible for ratification after, and only if, the community approved the corresponding Budget Info Action in effect with DRep approval above the 50 percent threshold. This sequencing aligns with the prerequisite budget requirement for withdrawals.","metadata_motivation":"### **Strategic Need**\n\nCardano has a strong technical and governance foundation, but lacks several critical integrations required for large-scale economic activity and external liquidity. The absence of key systems, including stablecoin infrastructures, interoperability frameworks, and institutional-grade pricing oracle networks limits the ecosystem’s capacity to attract external capital, facilitate stable on-chain operations, and support advanced DeFi use cases. Cardano also requires institutional digital asset custody and wallet infrastructures, as well as on-chain analytics platforms to ensure user access, ecosystem transparency, and multi-chain liquidity efficiency. While none of these integrations in themselves are ‘silver bullets’, taken as a whole, they will provide the essential foundations to connect Cardano to the wider Web3 landscape and pave the way for accelerated growth.\n\n* **Stablecoins**  \n  With data and interoperability in place, Cardano can support the introduction of a tier-one stablecoin, the ecosystem’s primary base currency. A stablecoin provides price stability, predictable liquidity, and access for both institutional and retail users. However, its deployment depends on reliable oracle data and established interoperability channels. As such, stablecoin integration is the final step in the infrastructure rollout sequence and the key enabler for large-scale DeFi adoption and sustained liquidity growth.\n\n* **Institutional Digital Asset Custodies and Wallet Infrastructures**  \n  User access and transaction flow depend on a high-quality wallet infrastructure that supports multi-asset management, seamless dApp interaction, and secure cross-chain functionality. Wallets serve as the primary interface between users and Cardano’s financial systems; therefore, scalable, reliable, and feature-rich wallet solutions are required to support onboarding, institutional usage, and mass-market adoption. Enhanced wallet capabilities also ensure that new infrastructure layers like bridges, analytics, and stablecoins remain accessible and usable for all users.\n\n* **On-chain Analytics Platforms**  \n  A mature financial ecosystem requires transparent, real-time insights into network activity, risk exposure, asset flows, and application performance. Advanced analytics platforms allow developers, institutions, compliance teams, and users to assess liquidity conditions, monitor protocol health, and make informed decisions. Without robust analytics, DeFi operations remain opaque, limiting institutional participation and hindering ecosystem-wide risk management.\n\n* **Cross-Chain Bridges**  \n  Once a reliable data layer is established, the next requirement is enabling liquidity and user movement between Cardano and other ecosystems. Bridge and interoperability infrastructures allow assets to transfer securely across blockchains, opening access to external liquidity pools and new user bases. Without these routes, Cardano remains isolated, constraining inflows of capital, developers, and institutional participants.\n\n* **Pricing Oracle Infrastructures**  \n  Oracles provide the external data required for DeFi & RWA operations, including asset pricing, risk management, and stablecoin collateralization. While current native providers deliver early coverage, Cardano still lacks a globally recognized, institution-grade pricing oracle provider. This limitation restricts the ability of major stablecoin issuers and financial applications to deploy on Cardano, as their operations require data from trusted pricing oracle networks. Establishing a robust pricing oracle infrastructure is the foundational step in enabling higher-level financial systems.\n\nThese integrations will provide the capability ‘rails’ for increased liquidity flow to Cardano which impact across ‘downstream’ metrics such as monthly active users, transaction volume, DeFi Total Value Locked (TVL), stablecoin liquidity/volume and more. However, people, incentives, products, and narratives are still needed to attract users and drive economic flow. As such, clear ecosystem KPIs, derived from the Cardano 2030 strategy that will be voted on via Info Action as a pillar of the 2026 budget, must be validated with the community as a separate workstream. Similar integrations are commonplace across leading L1 projects and, when combined with supporting activities and incentives to drive awareness and user onboarding, have demonstrated positive liquidity inflows and network value.\n\n### **Current Gap & Urgency**:\n\nDespite being a top-10 blockchain by market cap, Cardano’s TVL as of November 25, 2025 remains around $191.86 million (Source: Defillama.com), which is still far below comparable ecosystems in DeFi trading volume and TVL. This gap highlights Cardano’s limited market reach and the absence of the core primitives that other networks treat as standard utilities. Without scaling these key components, Cardano risks falling further behind in attracting dApps, liquidity, institutional partners, and large-scale integrations such as tier-one stablecoins.\n\nCardano’s growth now depends on institution grade pricing oracles and interoperability layers linking on chain applications to external networks and real world data. These integrations are capital intensive and time sensitive, yet foundational for every future financial primitive. This proposal is advanced now because priority negotiations have reached an executable stage and can be finalized upon funding.\n\n### **Why Treasury Funding**\n\nThe Cardano ecosystem needs foundational public infrastructure that every dApp depends on. Certain components cannot practically be built or licensed by individual teams; they are shared utilities that must be delivered at ecosystem scale, to unlock liquidity, attract users and developers, and enable institutional use cases. The Constitution states “The Cardano Community is expected to periodically propose one or more budgets for the ongoing operation, maintenance and future development of the Cardano”.\n\nBy placing the budget under Intersect administration, all fund flows follow constitutional guardrails: separate auditable addresses, auto-abstain delegation, milestone validation, independent audits, dispute resolution, and public reporting. This ensures full community oversight from start to finish and reinforces decentralized governance across the entire integration pipeline.\n\n### **Timeline & Current State of Governance**\n\nThis Treasury Withdrawal is submitted in parallel with the “Cardano Critical Integrations Budget” Info Action and the recent “2025 Net Change Limit Extension” Info Action. Running these actions together allows DReps to consider the full budget and the concrete withdrawal at the same time.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Treasury Withdrawal may only be enacted if, at the time of enactment:\n\n* The Cardano Critical Integrations Budget Info Action has been approved by DReps at the required threshold and has not been determined unconstitutional by the Constitutional Committee  \n* The withdrawal is being made pursuant to an approved Net Change Limit; the Constitutional Committee is in a state of confidence, is at or above its minimum required size and has voted that this Treasury Withdrawal is Constitutional.\n\nWhile this Treasury Withdrawal runs in parallel with the related Info Actions it is slightly staggered, so that DReps are able to signal their support in conjunction with the ongoing Budget Info Action, and the Constitutional Committee members will have a period of time after the Budget Info Action voting closes to assess constitutionality of this Treasury Withdrawal within the applicable govActionLifetime.\n\nIf any of these conditions are not met, including if the Cardano Critical Integrations Budget Info Action fails, if the Net Change Limit extension Info Action fails or is not in force for the relevant period, or if the Constitutional Committee is not restored to at least its minimum size, then the Treasury Withdrawal may be deemed unconstitutional.\n\n### **Steering Committee**\n\nThe Steering Committee provides high-level business direction and integration governance of this initiative. The committee oversees negotiation strategy, prioritization of integrations, and overall alignment with Cardano’s ecosystem needs. Its purpose is to ensure that each integration delivers clear strategic value and that decisions are made in the best interest of the ecosystem.\n\nThe Steering Committee operates as a five-member group representing Input | Output Global, the Cardano Foundation, EMURGO, Midnight Foundation and Intersect. These members act independently to maintain neutrality. Together, they evaluate which integrations should be onboarded first, assess ecosystem impact, and guide the negotiation of commercial and contracting terms with integration partners. The Steering Committee voting members will not be compensated from withdrawn funds and will each cover their own expenses. An amount of no more than 5% of the budget will be allocated to legal, custodian fees, administration, and compliance costs of the Administrator and connected parties.\n\nThe Steering Committee comprises representatives from each of the following organizations:\n\n* Input | Output Group  \n* Cardano Foundation  \n* EMURGO  \n* Midnight Foundation  \n* Intersect (as a non-voting member acting in the capacity of the Administrator)\n\nWhile ultimate accountability and delegated authority sits with the Steering Committee, dedicated sub-working groups will take operational responsibility across key areas such as commercial, legal, technical delivery, and communications/community engagement. Conflict of interest policies will be applied to the Steering Committee and the Treasury Reserve Smart Contract Oversight Committee members when making allocation and disbursal decisions.\n\nIn order to expedite these workstreams, a clear structure is required to ensure responsibility and accountability, both between the Steering Committee members organizations and to the community. While some elements of this structure are still being finalized, the intent is clear: collective action where coordination improves efficiency, combined with individual accountability so that responsibilities cannot become diffuse or ambiguous. For the avoidance of doubt, Intersect in its role as Administrator, commits to administering funds for the sole purpose as defined in the Budget Info Action and this Treasury Withdrawal.","metadata_references":"[{\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Cardano Constitution\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafkreiazhhawe7sjwuthcfgl3mmv2swec7sukvclu3oli7qdyz4uhhuvmy\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Definitions for the Cardano Constitution\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafkreiewp5bgrdiesq6ft3qypykgcjhvfgpp4s5o4yrjrvko4wuhi4iecu\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Automating Accountability: Cardano's Smart Contract Framework Blog\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafybeihqx4ae72z7suqfnxrpqpqithp43cai7o2uuewnqtezgaoyc3ptyq\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Sundae Labs Budget Management Smart Contracts Github Repository\", \"uri\": \"https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Budget Management Smart Contracts TxPipe Audit Report\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafybeiccnwejbgj43wo6hrlseckkkmprtoqc5cfuy2hesm6c6yealwho3e\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Budget Management Smart Contracts MLabs Audit Report\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafybeiah5fnjhda5hemj3qvaehc4mre3qllqzw2l7mkdsguytn4ftgafw4\"}]","metadata_resolved":1,"metadata_hash_valid":1,"proposer_address":"","param_changes":null,"treasury_amount_lovelace":70000000000000,"treasury_recipients":"[{\"stake_address\": \"stake1uxzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6g7lgq9r\", \"amount\": \"70000000000000\"}]","flags":"[]","flag_score":0,"first_seen":"2026-02-09T18:50:25.950966+00:00","last_updated":"2026-02-09T22:00:01.543836+00:00"},

It will also help accelerate ecosystem efforts in other key areas such as Real World Assets (RWA) and DePin. This acceleration is expected to play a key role in supporting Cardano’s path to profitability as a layer one in terms of fee generation, ensuring long-term financial sustainability.\n\nThis project is being driven through close collaboration between Input | Output Global, the Cardano Foundation, and EMURGO, together with Midnight Foundation and Intersect, all of whom are actively engaged in negotiations with integration partners. Representatives from all five organizations form the Steering Committee, which is responsible for making key strategic decisions. The founding entities and Intersect also recognize the Midnight Foundation’s contributions to date.\n\nInfrastructure providers and/or protocol collaborations are in a mature stage, and several partners have already provided detailed pricing and delivery timelines. However, for reasons of strategic and commercial confidentiality, together with partner companies’ compliance requirements, the specific infrastructures involved can only be disclosed outside of the Steering Committee after the integration is completed.\n\nThe project will follow a milestone-based funding structure, with budget drawdowns executed from Intersect’s custody and administration only upon submission of signed agreements and the agreed scope of work. The Oversight Committee at Intersect will review drawdown requests to confirm that the amounts and designated recipients align with the executed contracts. Since work is already underway in some of these areas, this proposal envisions an early early budget deployment, and we anticipate this budget being utilized immediately and up to 24-month deployment, depending on withdrawal success, contracting periods, and timely receipt.","metadata_rationale":"The Cardano Critical Integrations Budget will use the requested ₳70,000,000 to cover:\n\n**• Integration and other necessary associated costs**  \nCover the integration work and all related expenses, including deployment development, licensing fees, maintenance costs, and any additional infrastructure required to support the integrations.\n\n**• Legal and Audit**  \nCover due diligence, legal, insurance, and compliance requirements, and periodic independent audits to satisfy the requirements of the Cardano Constitution.\n\n**• Contingency Reserve**  \nMaintain a reserve to accommodate scope adjustments or market shifts, while preserving delivery certainty and financial discipline.\n\n**• Admin Fees**  \nCover custody fees, minting fees of stablecoins, and any other administrative costs that may arise during setup and execution of the Cardano Critical Integrations Budget\n\n₳ 70,000,000 refers to the remaining funds available within the current NCL. A high-level budget breakdown is planned to be included in the subsequent Treasury Withdrawal Governance Action following this Budget Info Action. However, due to confidentiality obligations applied by most integration partners, the breakdown will be limited in granularity. If the allocated budget is not used at the end of the 24-month period, all remaining funds will be returned to the Cardano Treasury.\n\n### **Administration of Funds**\n\nAll treasury funds will be administered by Intersect as an Administrator under Cardano’s constitutional framework. All treasury funds for this initiative will be administered by Intersect under Article IV of the Constitution. Intersect acts as the administrator for the entire budget. Contracting for integrations will be assigned on the principle of budget compatibility and “most likely to succeed”, i.e. to any entity that has the required skills and availability. This Budget Info Action is submitted by Intersect with support and the collaboration of the Cardano Foundation, Input Output Global, and EMURGO as co-proposers.\n\n#### Steering Committee Authority\n\nThe Steering Committee will negotiate commercial terms with integration partners and will include a technical assessment of feasibility and implementation requirements.\n\nAllocations from this budget will be approved by the Steering Committee. The quorum for any budget allocation to an integration will be 3/4 of all Steering Committee members. Once an integration is approved, Intersect will administer and execute the associated disbursements to the contracting entity, as defined for each integration.\n\nThe Steering Committee will publish progress reports upon achieving integration milestones\n\n## **Role of Intersect and Contractual Counterparties**\n\nIntersect will receive the funds and administer this budget. If this Budget Info Action and the subsequent Treasury Withdrawal are approved, funds will be received into the Treasury Reserve Smart Contract framework administered by Intersect with checks and balances from the independent smart contract Oversight Committee made up of five members; the Cardano Foundation, NMKR, Xerberus, SundaeLabs and Dquadrant. Funds from there will be disbursed transparently according to the contracting arrangements. Disbursements will be made directly from the smart contract framework or an institutional-grade custodian to vendors, as selected by the Steering Committee. It is currently not envisioned that the smart contract framework deployed earlier this year will be fully utilized, as this will likely result in disclosure of integration costs, which are typically confidential and protected by non-disclosure agreements. Intersect and the co-proposers will endeavor to negotiate integration contracts that allow for as much public disclosure as reasonably possible and the Steering Committee will disclose such information in their progress reports.\n\nCo-proposers or other entities chosen by the Steering Committee from time to time may, if required, act as the contracting counterparty with an integration partner. When this occurs, Intersect and the Cardano Development Holdings will enter into a contract with the designated entity defining the scope, obligations, reporting requirements, and drawdown conditions. Under this arrangement, the designated entity receives disbursements from related smart contract/s or custodians as determined by the contract terms.\n\nIntersect will only act as a contracting counterparty when it has completed its own due diligence and satisfied its Delivery Assurance standards. If Intersect declines to act as counterparty for a specific integration, another designated entity may do so, provided that a contract is established between that designated entity, Intersect and the for the purpose of receiving budget disbursements.\n\n## **Payment Execution and Safeguards**\n\nDisbursements will be executed through either smart contracts or institutional-grade custodians. These disbursements will follow the Statements of Work and the commercial terms approved by the Steering Committee.\n\n## **Unused funds and program conclusion**\n\nIf at the end of the 24 months period the budget has not been fully utilized, all remaining funds will be returned to the Cardano Treasury. A final reconciliation and summary will be included in the oversight reporting by Intersect, in collaboration with the Steering Committee.\n\n### **Cardano Addresses**\n\nTreasury funds will be received and held by Intersect, acting as the Constitutional Administrator, in addresses or accounts designated exclusively for this proposal and auditable by the community.\n\nTo fulfil constitutional requirements, these addresses will be delegated to the Auto-Abstain DRep and will not be staked to any Stake Pool Operator (SPO), ensuring that the funds do not influence governance or generate staking rewards. It is currently not envisioned that smart contracts will be fully used by Intersect to disbursement funds, to protect the confidentiality of vendor pricing. However, they will be used where possible and Intersect will be able to ensure oversight and transparency through the independent audit and access to information.\n\nThrough this arrangement, Intersect maintains full custody transparency, enabling verifiable auditing and milestone tracking under Cardano’s constitutional governance framework, satisfying Articles IV(2), (4) & (5) in particular.\n\n### **Goals & Metrics**\n\n| Category | Target | Verification Source |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| Stablecoin | A tier-one stablecoin is targeted for deployment on Cardano mainnet as the integrations progress. | The integration is live on Cardano Mainnet. |\n| Institutional digital asset custody and wallet infrastructure | The program aims to support the deployment of a tier-one stablecoin on Cardano mainnet as delivery progresses. | The integration is live on Cardano Mainnet. |\n| On-chain analytics platform | Tier-one analytics platform targeted for mainnet. | The integration is live on Cardano Mainnet. |\n| Cross-chain bridge | A tier-one cross-chain bridge is planned for mainnet deployment as integration work with selected partners is finalised. | The integration is live on Cardano Mainnet. |\n| Pricing oracle | Tier-one pricing oracle targeted for mainnet. | The integration is live on Cardano Mainnet. |\n| Transparency compliance | Completed milestones reported through the Intersect channel. | Intersect reports. |\n| Audit completion | Annual independent audit conducted and published, following Intersect’s current financial reporting framework for Tier 3 full assurance. | Intersect reports. |\n\n### **Acceptance Criteria and Milestone-Based Disbursement**\n\nThe acceptance criteria will vary between vendors, but will be made public once commercial terms and contracting has been agreed between the vendor, Intersect and the Steering Committee. It is expected a “milestone zero” payment will cover the essential setup costs of this initiative, which may include converting ada into a stablecoin, stablecoin minting fees, and custody fees. Converted assets will be held in a regulated custodian. Legal costs for onboarding integration partners are also included in this early operational budget.\n\nIn general, integration partners will receive funds only after verified delivery of agreed technical and operational milestones. That said, payment structures may vary deal to deal. Where a partner requires funds in advance to commence delivery, an upfront payment may be made at the point of contract signature. Any such upfront disbursement or “milestone zero” payment will be explicitly defined in the agreement and tied to a clear scope and deliverables.\n\nIntegrations requiring ongoing support may receive additional approved maintenance payments during the program period.\n\nThis disbursement structure ensures efficient execution, transparent financial management, and strict alignment with Cardano’s governance requirements.\n\n### **Reporting**\n\nIntersect and the Steering Committee will publish a bi-annual report covering:\n\n1. **Financial Summary & Treasury Reconciliation** – total funds disbursed, remaining, and audited.  \n2. **Project Progress & Milestone Review** – integration status and outcomes.  \n3. **Audit & Compliance Statement** – summary of independent audit findings.  \n4. **Ecosystem Impact Assessment** – measurable effects on Cardano adoption and interoperability.  \n5. **Governance & Future Outlook** – proposed next steps or renewal recommendations.\n\n## Constitutionality Checklist\n\n### **Article III.5**\n\n✔️ This proposal is prepared in a standardized and legible format and will include a URL and hash of all off-chain materials at submission. It provides a clear title, abstract, rationale, motivation, and supporting information in accordance with this article.\n\n### **Article IV.1**\n\n✔️This proposal fits the purpose of Article IV.1 as it supports the maintenance, operation, and future development of the Cardano ecosystem through critical integrations.\n\n### **Article IV.2**\n\n✔️This proposal specifies Intersect as the administrator and outlines transparent reporting, an oversight structure and explains where the processes are or are not administered via smart contracts (where it is not possible or beneficial). These elements meet the constitutional requirement for the use of administrators and on-chain tools where beneficial.\n\n### **Article IV.4**\n\n✔️This proposal allocates a budget for independent audits and includes clear oversight metrics & mechanisms such as contractual milestone-based verification, bi-yearly reporting, dispute resolution provisions (to be included in relevant legal contracts), and a defined Steering Committee. These elements satisfy the constitutional requirements for audits and oversight metrics.\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nThe Cardano Critical Integrations Budget is a decisive step toward addressing one of Cardano’s most pressing issues: the lack of mature oracle and interoperability integrations, alongside other core integrations required for large scale DeFi and attracting external liquidity. With these foundational integrations in place, and with tier-one stablecoin onboarding, Cardano can finally overcome the barriers that have historically prevented developers, institutions, and liquidity from other leading blockchains from entering Cardano.\n\nThis proposal unlocks the power of decentralized governance and transforms weakness into strength by allocating ₳70,000,000 in constitutionally governed, milestone-based funding. This funding supports the full rollout sequence of ecosystem critical integrations, including institutional digital asset custody and wallet infrastructures, tier one on-chain analytics platforms, cross-chain bridges, and globally recognized pricing oracles, all of which together provide the essential data, liquidity pathways, user access, and stablecoin rails on which every thriving DeFi network relies.\n\nTransparently administered by Intersect under Cardano’s governance framework and guided by an experienced Steering Committee, The Cardano Critical Integrations Budget ensures verifiable outcomes and measurable ecosystem value through clear contracting, milestone verification, and independent audits. It is a catalyst that demonstrates how decentralized governance can responsibly allocate capital while accelerating the delivery of critical integrations that will ensure Cardano’s long-term competitiveness and sustainability.","metadata_motivation":"### **Strategic Need**\n\nCardano has a strong technical and governance foundation, but lacks several critical integrations required for large-scale economic activity and external liquidity integration. The absence of key systems, including stablecoin infrastructures, interoperability frameworks, and institutional-grade pricing oracle networks limits the ecosystem’s capacity to attract external capital, facilitate stable on-chain operations, and support advanced DeFi use cases. Cardano also requires solid institutional digital asset custody and wallet infrastructures, as well as on-chain analytics platforms to ensure user access, ecosystem transparency, and multi-chain liquidity efficiency.\n\n* **Stablecoins**  \n  With data and interoperability in place, Cardano can support the introduction of a tier-one stablecoin, the ecosystem’s primary base currency. A stablecoin provides price stability, predictable liquidity, and access for both institutional and retail users. However, its deployment depends on reliable oracle data and established interoperability channels. As such, stablecoin integration is the final step in the infrastructure rollout sequence and the key enabler for large-scale DeFi adoption and sustained liquidity growth.\n\n* **Institutional Digital Asset Custodies and Wallet Infrastructures**  \n  User access and transaction flow depend on a high-quality wallet infrastructure that supports multi-asset management, seamless dApp interaction, and secure cross-chain functionality. Wallets serve as the primary interface between users and Cardano’s financial systems; therefore, scalable, reliable, and feature-rich wallet solutions are required to support onboarding, institutional usage, and mass-market adoption. Enhanced wallet capabilities also ensure that new infrastructure layers like bridges, analytics, and stablecoins remain accessible and usable for all users.\n\n* **On-chain Analytics Platforms**  \n  A mature financial ecosystem requires transparent, real-time insights into network activity, risk exposure, asset flows, and application performance. Advanced analytics platforms allow developers, institutions, compliance teams, and users to assess liquidity conditions, monitor protocol health, and make informed decisions. Without robust analytics, DeFi operations remain opaque, limiting institutional participation and hindering ecosystem-wide risk management.\n\n* **Cross-Chain Bridges**  \n  Once a reliable data layer is established, the next requirement is enabling liquidity and user movement between Cardano and other ecosystems. Bridge and interoperability infrastructures allow assets to transfer securely across blockchains, opening access to external liquidity pools and new user bases. Without these routes, Cardano remains isolated, constraining inflows of capital, developers, and institutional participants.\n\n* **Pricing Oracle Infrastructures**  \n  Oracles provide the external data required for DeFi & RWA operations, including asset pricing, risk management, and stablecoin collateralization. While current native providers such as Charli3 and Orcfax deliver early coverage, Cardano still lacks a globally recognized, institution-grade pricing oracle provider. This limitation restricts the ability of major stablecoin issuers and financial applications to deploy on Cardano, as their operations require data from trusted pricing oracle networks. Establishing a robust pricing oracle infrastructure is the foundational step in enabling higher-level financial systems.\n\n### **Current Gap & Urgency**:\n\nDespite being a top-10 blockchain by market cap, Cardano’s Total Value Locked (TVL) as of November 25th, 2025 remains around $191.860.000 (Source: Defillama.com), which is still far below comparable ecosystems that maintain several billion dollars in DeFi usage. This gap highlights Cardano’s limited market reach and the absence of the core primitives that other networks treat as standard utilities. Without scaling these key components, Cardano risks falling further behind in attracting dApps, liquidity, institutional partners, and large-scale integrations such as tier-one stablecoins.\n\nCardano’s growth requires robust pricing oracles and interoperability layers to connect on-chain applications to external networks and real-world data. These integrations are capital-intensive and time-sensitive, yet they underpin the viability of all future financial primitives.\n\nThis proposal is being brought forward now because discussions on these topics have progressed substantially, and are ready to move forward with various partners. With the current NCL set to expire on 4 January 2026, it is both timely and prudent to submit this proposal and its associated withdrawal under the present NCL, provided the community approves.\n\nBy establishing a transparent ecosystem integration budget through treasury funding, Cardano can secure these essential components rapidly and fairly.\n\n### **Why Treasury Funding**\n\n* **Ecosystem Criticality**  \n  The Cardano ecosystem needs foundational public infrastructure that every dApp depends on. These components cannot be built or licensed by individual teams; they are shared utilities that must be delivered once, at ecosystem scale, to unlock liquidity, attract developers, and enable institutional use cases.\n\n* **Neutrality & Vendor Independence**  \n  Treasury funding ensures that a broad coalition of Cardano stakeholders will determine which critical integrations are onboarded. This avoids commercial bias, guarantees neutrality, and allows the integrations to be governed transparently under Cardano’s constitutional framework.\n\n* **Governance Alignment & Transparency**  \n  By placing the budget under Intersect administration, all fund flows follow constitutional guardrails: separate auditable addresses, auto-abstain delegation, milestone validation, independent audits, and public reporting. This ensures full community oversight from start to finish and reinforces decentralized governance across the entire integration pipeline.\n\n### **Timeline & Current State of Governance**\n\nThis budget info action and its associated treasury withdrawal governance action will seek to pass prior to the expiry of the current NCL on 4 January 2026. While this is an ambitious timeline, it is believed to be possible with expedient voting from DReps and the CC, and justified on the underlying need for this proposal and motivation expressed above.\n\nThe withdrawal timeline is envisaged as follows:\n\n* 27 November 2025: Submission of this budget info action.  \n* As early as the 4 December 2025: Provided there is sufficient DRep approval at this stage and signs are not overwhelmingly negative, the associated treasury withdrawal will be submitted in parallel to allow DReps to consider the withdrawal and begin voting. This will still be subject to the CC vote and passing of this budget info action.  \n* 8 December 2025: The update CC governance action will be launched (based on current timelines announced by Intersect)  \n* 30 December 2025: This budget info action expires\n* 4 January 2026: Provided that the new CC is appointed; the CC have voted; DReps have approved the budget info action and DReps have cast sufficient votes for the treasury withdrawal - then the treasury withdrawal will pass on the final day of the current NCL.\n\nThe treasury withdrawal will not be deemed constitutional until the budget info action passes on 30 December 2025 (if DReps and CC approve), however, DReps will be able to vote on the actions and express their view from as early as 4 December 2025. CC members may also cast preliminary opinions on constitutionality during the period of voting on the budget info action, and finalise their opinions on the treasury withdrawal between 30 December 2025 and 4 January 2026.\n\nIt is fully acknowledged that there are multiple dependencies to the passing of the treasury withdrawal governance action, however it is technically feasible with sufficient community support, which we hope to receive.\n\n### **Steering Committee**\n\nThe Steering Committee provides high-level business direction and integration governance of this initiative. The committee oversees negotiation strategy, prioritization of integrations, and overall alignment with Cardano’s ecosystem needs. Its purpose is to ensure that each integration delivers clear strategic value and that strategic decisions are made transparently, rationally, and in the best interest of the ecosystem.\n\nThe Steering Committee operates as a five-member group representing Input | Output Global, the Cardano Foundation, EMURGO, Midnight Foundation and Intersect. These members act independently to maintain neutrality.

This was only a symbolic governance action, as it simply asked the community whether they agreed with a statement thanking those that helped get Cardano to this point and expressing a sense of hope for the future.\n\nUnfortunately, due to a bug in the code of the Cardano node that permitted an unregistered stake key to be used in the governance action, the submitter was unable to recover their deposit of 100K ada. While the community expressed at the time the importance of reimbursing this deposit via a treasury withdrawal; once the ability to do so became available, following the Plomin hard fork; unfortunately none of the entity based budget submissions have included this.\n\nThe Cardano in Oceania initiative did include the deposit reimbursement in their budget Info governance action, however their governance action was not approved.

This proposal is the **first-ever loan-based treasury withdrawal** in Cardano governance, introducing a new model of accountability where funds are not given as grants but repaid with interest.\n\nAs part of the governance process, a Board of Advisors will be appointed to ensure transparent execution and maximize ecosystem alignment. This board will include high-profile industry veterans like Tal Cohen (former CEO of Kraken), Phillip Pon (CEO of Emurgo), Fahmi Syed (President of Midnight Foundation), and Frederik Gregaard (CEO of Cardano Foundation), with additional top-tier names to be announced.\n\n*SNEK is the largest community token on Cardano, holding the highest market capitalization, over 42,000 wallets, and more than 2 billion ADA in all-time trading volume.*\n\nOver the past two years, the Snek Foundation has already invested over $5 million, entirely self-funded, to secure major exchange listings. Snek delivered the first, second, and third-ever Tier 1 listings for any Cardano native token, with Kraken, Crypto.com, and Kucoin, setting historic precedents for the ecosystem. With this proposal and with the support of our partners, we aim to unlock greater visibility, liquidity, and accessibility for the broader Cardano ecosystem by leveraging SNEK’s proven momentum and market position.\n\nThis loan will be continuously repaid from Snek network activities, with a final balance plus interest settled after a closing audit in three to five years. Interest is set at 2.44% annualized (2.37% staking rate + 0.07%), compounded yearly.\n\nBy structuring this as a repayable loan, the Snek Foundation is once again trailblazing for the ecosystem; demonstrating how treasury capital can be deployed responsibly while setting a precedent for future projects.\n\nThis treasury withdrawal follows the approved Budget: ₳5M Loan for Cardano's Global Listing Expansion - Powered by Snek ([gov_action1jr84r96lnsvu9yd6c0jhxe9gj5r7vnd2pgkntc6klplxdpyzz4tqqc9uldx](https://gov.tools/outcomes/governance_actions/90cf51975f9c19c291bac3e57364a89507e64daa0a2d35e356f87e6684821556#0)). The administrator of the budget funds will be Intersect, utilizing the treasury-contracts framework to manage funds.","metadata_rationale":"### Executive summary\n\nThe SNEK Global Exchange Expansion initiative will execute a targeted listing strategy, using the requested 5M ada to:\n\n- Finalize negotiations and secure multiple top-tier listings on centralized exchanges, retail brokers, and innovative DeFi platforms\n\n- Provision liquidity and market making for ADA/SNEK pairs\n\n- Cover legal and compliance costs to meet exchange requirements\n\n- Fund mandatory coordination and announcement campaigns\n\n- Report expenditures and impact transparently to the community\n\n## Loan terms\n\n**Principal:** 5 million ada\n\n**Interest Rate:** 2.44% APR The loan will accrue interest at the current average Cardano staking rewards rate of 2.37% per year, plus an additional 0.07% as a gesture of good faith.\n\n**Repayment Timeline:** Repayments will be made continuously to the Cardano Treasury through multiple ways, including but not limited to: Snek network activities and direct payment from the Snek Foundation. Early payments may begin at any time. Principal repayment (without interest) must commence no later than the last day of year 3.\n\n**Audit & Review:** At the end of year 3, an independent audit will be conducted to review the repayments already made through Snek network activities revenues and contributions. The audit will verify the amounts reimbursed to date, calculate any outstanding principal and interest, and establish a repayment schedule to ensure the full balance is reimbursed over the remaining years.\n\n**Default & Enforcement:** In the unlikely event of non-repayment, the obligation will remain enforceable under the binding loan agreement administered by Intersect on behalf of the Treasury. Remedies and next steps would follow the terms of that contract.\n\n**Loan Maturity:** The full loan (principal + interest) must be repaid in full within 5 years from the date of disbursement.\n\n## Costs Breakdown\n\nWe heard and understand the feedback from several DReps requesting a detailed cost breakdown. However, certain elements of this initiative require discretion to preserve strategic leverage and protect the integrity of ongoing negotiations.\n\nA detailed cost breakdown has therefore been intentionally withheld to protect the strategic execution of this initiative.\n\nGiven the competitive and negotiation-sensitive nature of centralized exchange listings and liquidity operations, publicly disclosing specific allocations could:\n\n* Undermine our negotiation position with exchanges and service providers;  \n* Expose execution timing and scope to traders, increasing the risk of market frontrunning/manipulation;  \n* Limit our ability to adapt dynamically to changing conditions across venues.\n\nThe broader goal of this initiative remains unchanged: to expand Cardano’s presence and address the underrepresentation of ADA-native tokens across external markets.\n\nWhile certain financial details cannot be shared in advance, the use of funds will still adhere strictly to the approved categories in this proposal and will be subject to independent audit and milestone-based review.\n\n## Administration of the loan\n\nThe administrator of the budget funds will be Intersect, offering continuous oversight. Expenditures will be tracked against the stated use of funds, with reporting, receipts, and independent audits ensuring that spending remains aligned with the proposal’s objectives. This approach provides the flexibility required to execute global listings while still offering the Treasury transparent, phased accountability.\n\nA public version of the loan agreement between Intersect and the Snek Foundation will be made available if this Treasury Withdrawal action passes, with sensitive information redacted for security and privacy reasons. The current draft loan agreement can be found in References.\n\nAdditionally, a Board of Advisors will be appointed to provide guidance, feedback, and external validation.\n\n**The board will include:**\n\n- Tal Cohen, former CEO of Kraken  \n- Frederik Gregaard, CEO of Cardano Foundation  \n- Phillip Pon, CEO of Emurgo  \n- Fahmi Syed, President of Midnight Foundation  \n- Rapha C-Roy, CEO of Snek Foundation\n\n**The board’s responsibilities:**\n\n- Advise key expenses  \n- Guide negotiations and legal strategy  \n- Ensure alignment with Cardano treasury goals  \n- Ensure outcomes benefit the Cardano ecosystem beyond SNEK  \n- Support documentation and distribution of listing playbooks to future Cardano-native token teams\n\nThis structure ensures that the project benefits from experienced external input while maintaining decentralized, community-led control over treasury execution.\n\nThe Board will also help facilitate knowledge sharing across the ecosystem by supporting documentation of listing procedures, exchange engagement strategy, and compliance best practices, enabling other Cardano native projects to benefit from this groundwork.\n\nAn allocation of 30-50k ada per year will be reserved out of the 5M for yearly independent external audit reports, ensuring that the loan is transparently monitored and fully accountable to the Treasury.\n\n### Loan Repayments\n\nThe loan is expected to be repaid over a five-year period, primarily through revenues generated across the Snek ecosystem.\n\n**Primary Source: Product and IP Revenues**  \nSnek Foundation generates revenues from a diversified portfolio of Web3 and Web2 products that together form the economic foundation of the Snek brand, including Snek.fun, SnekBot, SnekX, SNEK ENERGY, Snek Figures and future physical or digital product lines.\n\nAs an example, Snek.fun has, in prior periods, demonstrated the capacity to generate around ₳100,000  per month, averaging roughly ₳3,000–3,500 per day. Even with no projected growth, that level of activity would represent more than ₳6 million over five years, illustrating the repayment potential from a single product line. Ongoing cross-chain expansions, including Midnight and other networks, are expected to further strengthen this base.\n\nBeyond Snek.fun, the Snek Foundation manages a range of Web3 and Web2 initiatives that supplement revenues.\n\n**Treasury Strength**  \nThe Snek Treasury, currently valued at approximately ₳10 million, provides an additional layer of repayment capacity and liquidity stability as ecosystem value grows.\n\n**Future Capital Raises**  \nAdditional capital inflows may also come from private or public equity rounds as the Snek ecosystem continues to expand.\n\n**Alternative sources**  \nNot to be excluded, fees generated through SNEK trading volume on partnered DEXs and CEX arbitrage could also be used as a repayment method. To date, the Snek Foundation has generated approximately ₳1.2 million in trading fees.\n\nTaken together, these factors demonstrate a clear and sustainable path to repayment, supported by diversified revenue streams, appreciating treasury assets, and long-term ecosystem growth.\n\n#### Repayment Schedule\n\nA detailed repayment schedule has been intentionally withheld to protect the strategic execution of this initiative. Publicly disclosing exact repayment timing or structure could reveal sensitive information about the Foundation’s revenue flows, commercial partnerships, and exchange operations; potentially exposing it to market speculation, counterparty leverage, or trading manipulation.\n\nThe loan will follow a five-year repayment framework, with the first repayment expected no later than the third year. Subsequent repayments will continue periodically until the full balance, including accrued interest, is repaid within the five-year term.\n\nRepayments will be made periodically, with interest accrued on the outstanding balance and payments applied first toward interest, then principal. The Snek Foundation also reserves the right to prepay any portion of the loan at any time without penalty, allowing acceleration of repayment if revenues exceed expectations.\n\nThis approach ensures the loan is repaid responsibly and transparently while maintaining the necessary confidentiality to execute effectively. Oversight will remain in place through milestone verification, reporting, and independent audit, ensuring accountability without compromising strategic flexibility.\n\n### Reporting\n\n#### Bi-Yearly Reports\n\nSnek Foundation will publish bi-yearly updates including:\n\n* Progress on exchange listings  \n* Funds spent with receipts when allowed  \n* All legal/compliance materials will be open-sourced when possible  \n* Learnings from legal, compliance, and integration processes  \n* Results of independent external audits  \n* Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)\n\n#### Success metrics\n\nTo demonstrate the success of the proposal over time, below is a preliminary, but not exhaustive, set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) covering exchange reach, liquidity, ecosystem impact, and repayment tracking:\n\n* Loan Utilization — % of funds spent  \n* Repayment Timeline — Amount of ADA repaid to the treasury over time  \n* Exchange Listings — Number of listings for SNEK  \n* Liquidity Growth — SNEK liquidity value on CEX order books and DEX pools  \n* Trading Volume Growth — SNEK daily average trading volume (CEX + DEX)  \n* On-chain Transaction Growth — SNEK daily average on-chain transaction\n\n#### Knowledge Sharing\n\nAll listing playbooks, integration frameworks, and documentation will be made available to the Cardano Foundation, Emurgo, IOG, and future token teams.\n\nWe will also collaborate with the Cardano Foundation to ensure effective knowledge transfer from this initiative, supporting future ecosystem efforts while staying within contractual and confidentiality boundaries.\n\nProgress will continue to be shared during Cardano town halls and across governance channels to maintain transparency and feedback loops.\n\n## Budget Administration\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract has been drafted between the Snek Foundation and Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), administered by Intersect, detailing delivery schedules, milestones, and dispute resolution processes. This Legal Contract will be confirmed and signed by the authorized persons if the Treasury Withdrawal is successful. More details can be found in the References.\n\n### Project Delivery\n\nMilestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts, and timelines will be agreed upon between Intersect and the Snek Foundation. The Snek Foundation will deliver according to the Legal Contract, with milestone completion attested by the Snek Foundation and verified by Intersect or a 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nIntersect’s delivery assurance function will monitor progress and communicate status to the community. A 3rd Party Assurer will review and sign off on milestone deliverables before payments are released.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nIntersect will use the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs, audited by TxPipe and MLabs. Funds will be held in a Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC) and disbursed to Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSCs) as milestones are met.\n\nThe Oversight Committee — consisting of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus, and NMKR — will verify key administrative actions on-chain.\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will reuse the infrastructure used for the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget. The same Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), will be used. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles.\n\nAn Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee’s role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration, please see the [Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration) on the knowledge base.\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. The logic of the TRSC and PSSC prevent them from delegating to SPOs, only allowing delegation to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. Thus funds held in administration by these contracts will be delegated to auto-abstain predefined DRep.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the Snek Foundation is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard is available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain. Please see [cardanotreasury.fi](http://cardanotreasury.fi).\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV sections 4 and 5.","metadata_motivation":"## Who we are\n\nSnek Foundation is a grassroots organization responsible for launching and maintaining the SNEK ecosystem. Snek has never raised external funds for exchange listings and has operated for the past 31 months, entirely self-funded through its revenue and treasury.\n\nSo far, more than $5 million has been invested by the Snek Foundation towards listing activities.\n\n**Since May 2023, Snek has:**\n\n- 42,000+ wallets holding SNEK — the most actively held token on Cardano  \n- 2,000,000,000 ADA in all-time trading volume — the most traded token on Cardano  \n- SNEK is the most well-known token in and out of the Cardano ecosystem, with 30 markets  \n- Self-funded $5M for exchange listing activities  \n- Delivered the three first-ever Tier 1 exchange listings for Cardano via Kraken, Crypto.com, and Kucoin.  \n- Developed the first-ever CEX-DEX market-making service with Flowdesk  \n- Launched Snek.fun, Cardano’s leading launchpad, driving over 30% of all chain trades since inception  \n- Trademarked brand with ongoing IP licensing deals (Snek Figures, Snek Energy)\n\nThe team has a successful track record negotiating listings, building tools, and driving global meme adoption aligned with Cardano’s values.\n\n## Why this proposal matters\n\nSNEK is Cardano’s most adopted token, yet it remains underrepresented on major centralized exchanges, reflecting a broader lack of visibility for Cardano on mainstream platforms and among broader audiences.\n\nThis underrepresentation doesn’t just affect SNEK. It weakens Cardano’s position in competitive markets and slows ecosystem-wide growth in four key areas:\n\n1. ADA’s visibility and liquidity on global platforms  \n2. Cardano’s competitiveness in retail-driven market cycles  \n3. The discoverability of Cardano’s ecosystem by mainstream users  \n4. CNT adoption and the path for other tokens to reach similar success\n\nCardano currently lacks a flagship token that drives liquidity, virality, and culture across exchange listings, just like DOGE, SHIBA, and PEPE do for Ethereum and Solana.  \nSNEK has already shown it can fill this role; now it needs support to break through at scale.\n\n**This proposal aims to address the following challenges:**\n\n- **Lack of exchange presence for Cardano native tokens:** Most major centralized exchanges and retail brokers still do not support Cardano Native Tokens (CNTs). This severely limits Cardano’s accessibility and competitiveness on a global scale. While Ethereum and Solana ecosystems enjoy deep integrations with top exchanges, Cardano-native projects are left with fewer liquidity pathways and less discoverability. Until CNTs are more visible on mainstream platforms, Cardano’s on-chain economy cannot reach its full potential.\n\n- **Low visibility for ADA pairings:** Centralized exchanges are the primary entry point for millions of users, yet ADA trading pairs are underrepresented relative to Cardano’s market cap. Without community-driven assets like SNEK creating demand for ADA pairings, liquidity remains shallow and volume muted. This proposal helps bootstrap those pairings, supporting deeper ADA liquidity and reinforcing Cardano’s relevance at the trading layer.\n\n- **Missed user acquisition:** In other ecosystems, memecoins like SHIB, DOGE, and PEPE have served as cultural gateways for millions of new retail users. These tokens create stories, engagement, and participation, driving demand for the base layer tokens and ecosystem tools. SNEK has proven it can play that role for Cardano. Without support to elevate its accessibility, Cardano risks missing this powerful user acquisition funnel.\n\n- **Liquidity fragmentation:** Cardano’s DeFi protocols face high barriers to liquidity aggregation due to the lack of bridgeable, on-ramp-compatible assets. Without listings on major exchanges, Cardano native assets remain siloed and isolated from the broader crypto capital flows, limiting scalability and adoption.\n\nBy funding this initiative, Cardano positions itself to solve these bottlenecks through a trusted, culturally strong and community-proven asset that can serve as a gateway for users and liquidity.\n\nToday, Snek is the only Cardano-native token capable of meeting Tier 1 exchange requirements. This makes it the best and currently only viable gateway to unlock the access, liquidity, and visibility Cardano needs at the global level.\n\nThe goal is not exclusivity — it’s scalability. By leading the way through Snek, we create a repeatable path for other CNTs to follow. The foundation has already begun sharing its knowledge with other projects post-Kraken, and through this proposal, will continue building and systematizing resources that can be shared with Cardano Foundation, Emurgo, and IOG.","metadata_references":"[{\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Approved Budget: \\u20b35M Loan for Cardano's Global Listing Expansion - Powered by Snek (GovTool)\", \"uri\": \"https://gov.tools/outcomes/governance_actions/90cf51975f9c19c291bac3e57364a89507e64daa0a2d35e356f87e6684821556#0\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Legal Agreement Executive Summary between CDH and Snek Foundation (PDF)\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafkreidyjljegwenjtbkg5x5zhhxoymmthnbeqvnzgyygkba7vwvqqyarm\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Legal Agreement between CDH and Snek Foundation (PDF)\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafybeifnatxysfb6wrd2wmcfv4h2ggzxbywyna4xhhtxqrlprfyfxak5se\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Snek Foundation (Website)\", \"uri\": \"https://www.snek.com/\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Snek Foundation (X)\", \"uri\": \"https://x.com/snek\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Rapha C-Roy, CEO @ Snek Foundation\", \"uri\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/in/raphacroy/\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Tal Cohen, former CEO of Kraken\", \"uri\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/in/talcohenprofile/\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Frederik Gregaard, CEO of Cardano Foundation\", \"uri\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregaard/\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Phillip Pon, CEO of Emurgo\", \"uri\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/in/phillip-pon-89666a2/\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Fahmi Syed, President of Midnight Foundation\", \"uri\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/in/fahmi-s-694b5414b/\"}]","metadata_resolved":1,"metadata_hash_valid":1,"proposer_address":"","param_changes":null,"treasury_amount_lovelace":5000000000000,"treasury_recipients":"[{\"stake_address\": \"stake1uxzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6g7lgq9r\", \"amount\": \"5000000000000\"}]","flags":"[{\"flag\": \"\\ud83d\\udfe1 NO_DISCUSSION\", \"severity\": \"yellow\", \"score\": 3, \"detail\": \"No links to forum discussion or community feedback\"}]","flag_score":3,"first_seen":"2026-02-09T18:50:25.950966+00:00","last_updated":"2026-02-09T22:00:01.543836+00:00"},

Carrying out this mandate requires careful review of governance actions, familiarity with the Constitution and governance mechanisms, and the capacity to act impartially. CC members also face significant administrative costs in performing these duties, including research, deliberation, drafting, and participation in cross-time-zone meetings.\n\nWithout compensation from a neutral source, participation risks being limited to those able to subsidize these costs themselves or they may be subsidized by another institution. This could result in an “ivory tower” where only the wealthy or well-connected are able to serve. Establishing a reasonable budget for compensation from the Cardano Treasury ensures that service in the CC accessible to a broad range of qualified contributors and the institution itself remains distinct and independent.\n\n### Participating Members\n\nThis governance action was built from discussion between the seven currently serving members of the CC and will provide for the compensation of five of these members.\n\nThe members seeking compensation are:\n\nCardano Atlantic Council, script-hash-349e55f83e9af24813e6cb368df6a80d38951b2a334dfcdf26815558\nTingvard, script-hash-1980dbf1ad624b0cb5410359b5ab14d008561994a6c2b6c53fabec00\nEastern Cardano Council, script-hash-84aebcfd3e00d0f87af918fc4b5e00135f407e379893df7e7d392c6a\nAce Alliance, script-hash-9752e4306e5ae864441d21064f791174c8b626199b8e7a45f9e03b45\nCardano Japan Council, script-hash-9cc3f387623f45dae6a68b7096b0c2e403d8601a82dc40221ead41e2\n\nThe members not seeking compensation are:\n\nKtorZ, key-hash-dc0d6ef49590eb6880a50a00adde17596e6d76f7159572fa1ff85f2a\nPhil_uplc, key-hash-13493790d9b03483a1e1e684ea4faf1ee48a58f402574e7f2246f4d4\n\n### Budget\n\nThe total amount of this budget shall be 1,000,000 Ada.\n\nEach of the five members seeking compensation shall be allowed to request up to 200,000 Ada as part of a single Treasury Withdrawal pursuant to the budget.\n\n### Administrator\n\nThe Administrator of this budget shall be a customized version of the open source Cardano Treasury/Vendor Smart Contract developed by Intersect & Sundae Labs. This Smart Contract will be deployed with the following conditions:\n\n#### Funding Method\n\n* A separate smart contract instance will be deployed for each CC member to ensure individualized oversight and accounting.\n* These five smart contract instances will be concurrently funded subject to the passage of a Treasury Withdrawal Governance Action specifying the amount that each contract is due to receive.\n* The Treasury Withdrawal Governance Action must be approved for submission by all members seeking compensation.\n\n#### Withdrawal Logic\n\n* The designated CC member may withdraw funds from the smart contract to an account in their custody once every six epochs.\n* Each withdrawal equals the proportionate share of their service time in the 73-epoch funding term (i.e., pro-rata vesting based on actual service).\n* Assets in the smart contract will only be able to be sent to the CC member account specified upon launch or the Cardano Treasury.\n\n#### Oversight & Audit Mechanism\n\n* Each CC member’s smart contract will be overseen and auditable by the other four CC members.\n* The other four CC members collectively hold the authority to pause further withdrawals if the designated member is no longer serving in their CC role.\n* There will be no capability in the smart contract to change the recipient of funds. If the CC member wishes to receive compensation to another account for some reason (i.e. they lost access to their original account) they will need to make a new budget request to Ada holders.\n\n#### Expiration & Fund Recovery\n\n* Any funds remaining in the contract six epochs after the close of the 73-epoch funding term will be swept back into the Cardano Treasury, ensuring no stranded or unclaimed funds persist indefinitely.\n\n### Dispute Resolution\n\nDispute resolution under this framework is handled directly by the smart contract through a vote of the four Constitutional Committee members overseeing each smart contract instance. If concerns arise regarding a designated member’s eligibility or continued service, the remaining CC members may cast votes within the contract to determine whether withdrawals should be paused or allowed to continue. A defined majority threshold ensures that no single member can unilaterally block or reinstate payments, while still allowing the CC itself to resolve disputes internally without requiring an external institution.\n\n### Reporting\n\nCC members will be expected to provide a public address, controlled by the individual or entity receiving funds, at the time they submit a Treasury Withdrawal Governance Action. This ensures transparency and accountability, as Ada holders will be able to independently review and verify each withdrawal by tracing transactions from the smart contract to the designated CC member’s custodied account using any blockchain explorer.\n\nIf it becomes necessary to freeze a contract and suspend withdrawals, that action and its justification must be publicly reported by the CC members voting to take such action. This will ensure that the community is aware of any exceptional circumstances.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, this framework provides a balanced approach to compensating Constitutional Committee members in a manner that is transparent, accountable, and aligned with Cardano’s governance principles. By leveraging smart contracts to automate withdrawals, enforce vesting schedules, and allow peer oversight with the ability to pause payments, the system ensures both fairness to participants and protection of community resources. The requirement for public reporting of custodied addresses and withdrawal records further reinforces trust, while the automatic return of unclaimed funds to the Treasury safeguards against waste.\n\nMost importantly, this model allows the CC to operate as an independent institution, free from undue influence or reliance on outside funding sources, thereby strengthening its ability to exercise impartial judgment in overseeing constitutional governance.\n\n## References","metadata_motivation":"The current Constitutional Committee (CC) was seated on the Cardano blockchain at the beginning of epoch 581.\n\nAccording to Article I, Section 1, Tenet 4 of the Cardano Constitution, “Contributions by the Cardano Community on the Cardano Blockchain shall be recognized, recorded and assessed fairly through reward sharing with SPOs, potential compensation to DReps and CC members, and appropriate tokenomics.”\n\nFurthermore, according to Article VII, Section 8, “Cardano Blockchain ecosystem budgets shall provide for periodic administrative costs of the Constitutional Committee in such amounts as requested from time to time by the Constitutional Committee and as approved by ada owners.”","metadata_references":"[{\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Cardano Constitution\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafkreiazhhawe7sjwuthcfgl3mmv2swec7sukvclu3oli7qdyz4uhhuvmy\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"CC Governance Action\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafkreicw6kinbtfwxygoj4jf7khextfq6a3yirlhkldhd7zizdq4xu2ghm\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Cardano Treasury/Vendor Smart Contract Code\", \"uri\": \"https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts\"}]","metadata_resolved":1,"metadata_hash_valid":1,"proposer_address":"","param_changes":null,"treasury_amount_lovelace":null,"treasury_recipients":null,"flags":"[]","flag_score":0,"first_seen":"2026-02-09T18:50:25.950966+00:00","last_updated":"2026-02-09T22:00:01.543836+00:00"},

Items Removed from Constitution v1.0\n\n### (a) Expectations and Encouragement clauses\n\nExpectations: ARTICLE III. Section 6 (off-chain governance management), ARTICLE V. Section 3 (DRep code of conduct), ARTICLE V. Section 4 (DRep selection tool), ARTICLE VII. Section 1 (CC expertise), ARTICLE VII. Section 7 (CC tool support)\n\nEncouragement: ARTICLE VI. Section 3 (SPO code of conduct), ARTICLE VIII. Section 1 (constitutional discussion)\n\nRationale: These provisions were aspirational or advisory in nature (expectations/encouragements), not enforceable constitutional rules.\n\n### (b) Budget Info Action Provisions (ARTICLE III. Section 4, ARTICLE IV, ARTICLE VII. Section 4)\n\nRationale: The Budget Info Action mechanism was removed to simplify governance. Its requirements have been absorbed into Treasury Withdrawal Governance Actions.\n\n### \\(c\\) Obligation to Create a CC Code of Conduct (ARTICLE VII. Section 6)\n\nRationale: This was considered an operational detail better left to community practice rather than a constitutional mandate. The CC may still adopt codes of conduct, but it is no longer a constitutional requirement.\n\n## 2. Changes and additions (excluding deletions)\n\n### (a) Overall - Fixed typos, simplified wording, and unified terminology.\n\nRationale: Improves readability and ensures consistency\n\n### (b) Defined Terms: - Added definitions such as Active Voting Stake, Ada Holders, DRep, SPO, Net Change Limit, Treasury Withdrawal Recipient.\n\nRationale: Eliminates ambiguity and ensures consistency in interpretation\n\n### \\(c\\) ARTICLE II, Section 6 – Introduced requirement that “The document hosted by such a URL shall be immutable.”\n\nRationale: ensure proposals cannot be altered after submission, protecting integrity and trust\n\n### (d) ARTICLE II Section 7 :Reassigned conditions previously tied to the Budget Info Action, making them mandatory at the time of Treasury Withdrawals after its removal\n\nRationale: strengthen accountability and transparency in the use of Treasury funds and preserve oversight and audit safeguards after removing the Budget Info Action mechanism\n\n# II.Simple summary of changes and reasons from Cardano Constitution v2.0 to v2.3\n\n## 1. Editorial & Structural Improvements\n\n* Terminology: Standardized terms like “Cardano Community Member”, “Ada Holders”.\n* Definitions: Definitions: Clarified the “Net Change Limit” (maximum treasury withdrawal per period) and refined the definition of “Stake Pool Operator” (the entity controlling cold keys).\n\n## 2. Section-Specific Revisions\n\n* ARTICLE II Section 1: Clarifies no formal membership is needed to use or benefit from Cardano.\n* ARTICLE II Section 5: Simplifies redundant provisions regarding SPOs.\n* ARTICLE II Section 6: Simplification of wording in some provisions.\n* ARTICLE II Section 7: (1) Removed: The requirement to include the “location and identity of the recipient” in withdrawal terms, the explicit requirement to budget for audit costs, and the explicit statement that “withdrawals shall be used for the purpose set out in paragraph 1” (2) Changed: The special requirements that previously applied only to withdrawals exceeding 1,000,000 ADA in a two-year period (i.e., appointing independent auditors and publishing annual reports, designating administrators to oversee funds, and keeping funds in auditable separate accounts delegated to abstain) now apply as general requirements for all withdrawals.\n* TREASURY-04a (x): Deletes requirement for treasury withdrawal roadmaps to be approved via Info Action.\n\n# III.Evidence of widespread community reviews:\n\nConstitution v2.0 received review and voting by 86.23% of total DRep voting power, including both Yes/No/Abstain votes.\nMany DReps submitted detailed analyses publicly.\nv2.3 builds on v2.0 with rational improvements and direct incorporation of on-chain feedback.\nConcerns regarding insufficient discussion of the constitution have been reasonably addressed in v2.3.","metadata_motivation":"# The proposed changes aim to:\n1.

Any unused funds will be returned to the Cardano Treasury.\n\n#### Active Development - Roadmap\n\nBecause GovTool's roadmap is directly defined by the Cardano community, so subject to change and evolution. The best place to check what's coming next is the community backlog [Governance Tools Community Backlog](https://github.com/orgs/IntersectMBO/projects/34/views/1) and the community discussion (recently started to make it easier to define direction) [GovTool discussions](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/govtool/discussions). \n\nHowever there are some key initiatives that already have clear community support and that this proposal commits to deliver (full details can be seen in the [shared GovTool roadmap](https://docs.gov.tools/important-updates/govtool-maintenance-ending-soon/updated-budget-proposal/proposed-roadmap)). High-level details below (the initiatives are in order of readiness for development):\n\n* Add support to **create and operate group (script-based) DReps**, this will enable smaller DReps to easily come together and build strong coalitions so further distributing voting power.  \n* **DRep history on the DRep page** to show what that DRep voted on, how and (if available) with what rationale, also show the delegations moving in and out. All this will provide better context to the delegator, also opening new options to sort and filter DReps so supporting liquid democracy.  \n* **DRep voting history on Governance Actions** to allow DReps and Ada holders to see directly on the Governance Action page, alongside all the context coming from the metadata, the details related to voting, making it easier also to see if their DRep voted as they expected, thus enabling liquid democracy.  \n* **Ability to submit more than one vote in one transaction**  \n* **Constitutional Committee details on Governance Actions** (both those up for voting and those that have been ratified or rejected). This will make it easier to see which constitutional committee voted on a specific Governance Action and why they voted in that way, all on the same page.  \n* **Add support for group proposers** to foster the creation of more governance actions, provide more clarity on-chain about where the proposal comes from  \n* **Integration with CoSponsor** to allow authors to crowdfund the cost of the Governance Action deposit, hence lowering the barrier for participation to the global community  \n* Add an **easier way for delegators to identify DReps** by helping find DReps that have voting history aligned with delegators voting principles.  \n* **Further expand open APIs coverage** to include access to submission for all types of governance actions. This will make it easier for other builders to include this critical feature faster, dramatically lowering the barriers to submit a governance action.  \n* Generally **expand options for individual contributions to the open source code**. Specifically integrate the GitHub backlog with the Andamio platform to allow anyone to get onboarded to the repos and be rewarded for meaningful contributions to key identified issues  \n* **Optimise the hosting and deployment infrastructure** to reduce cost and make general maintenance more efficient\n\n#### Governance\n\nThe Governance Tools working group in Intersect, is responsible for coordinating efforts related to governance tooling in general, hosting discussions about current and future needs. Over the past 18 months, the working group focused on channeling community direction for the GovTool project. Going forward the working group, on top of supporting broader discussions across tools, will continue supporting the newly formed GovTool consortium, acting also the meeting space for it when useful.\n\nThe GovTool Consortium, open to any contributor who actively joins the discussions, will keep collecting input and feedback from the users and owners of GovTool (Cardano Community) and shape the roadmap direction. This will also act as the coordinator to transparently allocate and distribute the incentives of this budget to individual contributors by leveraging the Andamio platform. In the short-term, this group will also help facilitate the open process to award to a builder the hosting and infrastructure maintenance role described in this budget.\n\n#### Vendor Profiles\n\nThe **Cardano GovTool Consortium** is made of all the builders currently actively working on the development of GovTool, the builders of tools who leverage GovTool APIs and code, and anyone who actively participates in the Governance tools working group. The following builders who are submitting this governance action are leading the Consortium effort:\n\n* [**LidoNation**](https://www.lidonation.com/en) - Outcomes pillar  \n* [**ByronNetwork**](https://byron.network) - Delegation & Voting pillars  \n* [**WeDeliver**](https://we-deliver.io/) - Proposal Discussion & Budget Proposals pillars  \n* [**Dquadrant**](https://dquadrant.com/) - End-to-end testing\n\nThese teams have been building governance tools since before CIP-1694, through SanchoNet GovTool, Voltaire GovTool, and the Chang&Plomin upgrades. All code is open-source and maintained in public repositories, with contributions from a global community of developers.\n\n#### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between each member of the GovTool consortium (vendor) and Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), administered by Intersect, detailing delivery schedules, milestones, and dispute resolution processes.\n\n#### Project Delivery\n\nMilestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts, and timelines will be agreed upon between Intersect and the vendors. Vendors will deliver according to the Legal Contract, with milestone completion attested by the vendors and verified by Intersect or a 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nIntersect’s delivery assurance function will monitor progress and communicate status to the community. A 3rd Party Assurer will review and sign off on milestone deliverables before payments are released.\n\n#### Budget Management Tooling\n\nIntersect will use the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs, audited by TxPipe and MLabs. Funds will be held in a Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC) and disbursed to Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSCs) as milestones are met.\n\nThe Oversight Committee — consisting of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus, and NMKR — will verify key administrative actions on-chain.\n\nNote: Dquadrant is present within the Oversight Committee and as a builder within the GovTools Consortium, they will abstain from any oversight of GovTool-related contracts.\n\nA public dashboard ([cardanotreasury.fi](http://cardanotreasury.fi)) will allow the community to audit fund flows, track milestones, and verify spending immutably on-chain.\n\n##### Specifics\n\nIntersect will reuse the infrastructure used for the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget. The same Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), will be used. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. A Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Xerberus, Dquadrant and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration, please see the [Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration) on the knowledge base.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n* TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify  \n  * Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-offs must authorize  \n* TRSC Disperse  \n  * Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize  \n* TRSC Pause and Resume  \n  * Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize  \n* TRSC Sweep  \n  * One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize  \n* TRSC Reorganize  \n  * Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n##### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. The logic of the TRSC and PSSC prevent them from delegating to SPOs, only allowing delegation to the auto-abstain predefined DRep.

The secondary goal is to generate revenue for the treasury. 50,000,000 ADA is requested to create a fund composed of ADA and fiat backed stablecoins to support the Cardano decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. The majority of the funds (99%) in this budget will be disbursed to DeFi protocols including decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and lending protocols to help seed liquidity on Cardano. Funds must only contain ADA, fiat backed stablecoins, and liquidity tokens from deployment into DeFi protocols. The funds will be managed from a smart contract administered by a 9 person interim committee composed of publicly identified individuals with oversight from a newly established treasury DAO (tDAO), where membership in the treasury DAO includes decentralized representatives (dReps). After 1 year, the tDAO will be required to elect a new committee or else no actions can be taken. The tDAO has the oversight abilities to impeach, elect, and ultimately shut down the fund and return funds to the treasury. In addition to the fund, this proposal will establish a number of public goods including a legal framework for future community involved proposals like this as well as an open source governance contract with executive and oversight functionality.","metadata_rationale":"### Administration\n\nThe fund will be administered by a smart contract with features defined in the Smart Contract document that can be found in the supplemental links. This section briefly describes the features and concepts, but the supplemental document fully defines the smart contract used to administer funds.\n\nThe smart contract used to administer funds will have two bodies: (1) a committee that performs executive functions and (2) a treasury decentralized autonomous organization (tDAO) composed of registered dReps that perform an oversight function.\n\nMembers of the administrating committee will have a start and end date for which their signatures will be valid. Funds in the smart contract can be used with a majority of signatures, and can be used for depositing liquidity into DEX and lending protocols or transferring funds to third parties for liquidation and stablecoin minting. Committee members may also remove or impeach other members (remove keys) to remove their ability to sign for the contract. This is a  security mechanism, for example if signing keys are exposed. Committee members may not add new members, and if a member is removed then the only way to add them back is through tDAO election.\n\nThe tDAO performs oversight functions on the smart contract, holding the administrating committee accountable. They can vote to turn off administrating committee actions, preventing the committee from performing any action except returning funds back to the treasury. The tDAO can both remove and elect new committee members, where elections consist of adding a new key to the contract that is tied to a start and end date (defining the term of the committee members service). All tDAO actions require a 51% majority of dReps to vote, with a 25% quorum.\n\n### Legal Structure\n\nCardano has been the leader in blockchain decentralization, and has the first and largest fully decentralized, community governed treasury. This requires legal structures to protect both the fund, dReps as members of the tDAO, and members of the committee. One or more legal entities will be created to support the fund. Legal structure is needed to give members of the committee and the tDAO standing and representation in court to protect and defend the funds. Legal structures to fully support the fund, the committee, and the tDAO will be proposed to the community and the final legal structure and costs will be included in the first withdrawal request. Jurisdictions under consideration are the Cayman Islands, British Virgin Islands, Marshall Islands and Switzerland. The United States may also be considered given the Wyoming decentralized unincorporated nonprofit association (DUNA).\n\nIt is important for legal reasons that the primary goal of the fund is to increase the depth of liquidity in the Cardano DeFi ecosystem, and the purpose of the committee is to manage treasury funds with oversight from dReps. The majority of any interest gained (85%) will be left in DeFi protocols to grow, with a small portion (15%) being sent back to the treasury. Thus, the committee is managing treasury assets for the public good of Cardano rather than operating an investment fund. This is analogous to the structures of other DAOs like Aave and Uniswap.\n\nThe legal structure will be clearly outlined and described in the first withdrawal action, with complete costs and timeline. The legal structure must be in place prior to the second withdrawal action. See the timeline section for more information on the withdrawal information.\n\n### Withdrawals and Budget\n\n#### Summary (Total Withdrawals  50,000,000 ADA)\n\nWithdrawal 1 (500,000 ADA max)\n\n* Amaru smart contract setup (25,000 ADA)  \n* Smart contract and UI development (200,000 ADA)  \n* Smart contract audit (75,000 ADA)  \n* Legal fees (200,000 ADA)\n\nWithdrawal 2 (49,500,000 ADA)\n\n* ADA liquidation and stablecoin mint cost (500,000 ADA)  \n* Liquidity deployment (49,000,000)\n\n#### Withdrawal 1  Max 500,000 ADA\n\nAll fees are maximum estimates, and exact costs, providers, and implementation plans will be included in the first withdrawal action. If some costs are less than expected and others more expensive, costs for specific items will be adjusted but the total for the first withdrawal action will not total more than 500,000 ADA. Any amount less than 500,000 ADA will be passed to the second withdrawal action and used to deploy into DeFi protocols. If there are any funds remaining at the conclusion of work, they must be returned to the treasury and the residual amount may be included in the second withdrawal action.\n\nThe first withdrawal will be made to an Amaru contract setup to pay for smart contract development, auditing, and payment of legal fees. The Amaru team will be paid to setup and provide support for any issues that might arise for the duration of the work.\n\nEither prior or after submission of the info action, RFPs will be sent to legal institutions for establishment of legal structures. The committee will evaluate initial responses and invite the best candidates to make final revisions that will be released for public comment and evaluation. The committee will review the merits of the final candidates along with public feedback to make a final decision that will be included in the first withdrawal. **The first withdrawal action must include the name of the institution, exact cost, and plan for establishment of legal structure for the treasury fund.**\n\nOnce this budget info action is approved, the committee will accept proposals for development of the smart contract and UI and proposals for smart contract auditors. It is possible for one team or organization to submit proposals for both smart contract development and auditing, but the same team cannot perform both development and auditing. Smart contracts and UI will be made fully open source, allowing similar initiatives to use the contracts. The specific development teams, implementation and coordination plan, and specific costs will be included in the first withdrawal action.\n\n#### Withdrawal 2  49,500,000 ADA\n\nThe legal structure for the fund must be established prior to submission of this withdrawal. Withdrawal of funds must be made to the administrating contract.\n\nOn successful passing of Withdrawal 2, the committee will request proposals from OTC desks and other suitable institutions that can liquidate ADA for dollars and mint stablecoins. Institutions should handle both liquidation of ADA and minting stablecoins. The committee will make public the most promising candidates and fees to receive public feedback, and the institution selected by the committee MUST be included in the second withdrawal. Exact costs for liquidation and minting as well as timeline must be included in the proposal.\n\nOn successful passing of Withdrawal 1, the committee will publicly request proposals from DEX and lending protocols to receive funds. Specific proposal criteria will be included in the RFP, but will require information on commitment to DeFi ethos, yield projections, and plans for attracting additional liquidity. Details for how the committee should make selections are detailed in the Governance Protocol in the supplemental links. The selected protocols and exact amounts sent to each protocol MUST be included in the second withdrawal.\n\n### People\n\nBelow are the 9 members of the interim administrating committee. They range in experience and background to help ensure the long term success and sustainability of the stablecoin liquidity. Additional info is included in the Interim Committee document in the supplemental links.\n\n1. Linda Roland (aka CryptoFly)  \n2. Darren Camas (IPOR Labs)  \n3. Nick Schaub, Ph.D. (aka Elder Millenial)  \n4. Giorgio Zinetti (Cardano Foundation)  \n5. Massimo Morini, Ph.D.  \n6. Darlington Wleh (Lido Nation)  \n7. Murasaki (EMURGO)  \n8. Raphael Christian-Roy (Snek Foundation)  \n9. Ryan Davis  (IOHK)\n\n### Constitutionality of the Budget\n\n**Purpose**: This proposal is for work intended to enhance the long term sustainability of Cardano by increasing stablecoin liquidity in the ecosystem.\n\n**Article III(5)**: This proposal fulfills this section of the Cardano Constitution by containing a Title, Abstract, Reason for Proposal (Motivation and Rationale), and Supporting Materials. An off-chain copy of this proposal is linked to as the last element of the Supporting Materials section and is a Github link with commit hash thus fulfilling the other requirement of this section to have an off-chain copy with document hash. The Supporting Materials is not included in Github version of the document since it contains the commit hash.\n\n**Article IV(1)**: We propose that this budget span 73 epochs (roughly 1 calendar year). This proposal does setup a framework for perpetual investment in Cardano, but the withdrawals must be completed within 1 year.\n\n**Article IV(2)**: Disbursements for this budget must be made to a smart contract composed of 9 independent administrating members with at 5 of 9 signing policy for spending funds along with community oversight mechanisms from dReps. The process of overseeing funds then requires 5 of the 9 independent administrating members agree to disbursement of funds to DeFi protocols. The smart contract must be the owner of any liquidity deposited into DeFi protocols, meaning liquidity tokens or any other assurance of liquidity must be held in the multisig wallet and should not be delegated to a third party. With this design, the committee will be the administrator of the budget and will directly oversee distribution of funds to protocols, with dReps having and oversight function that permits shutting the fund down and returning back to the treasury.\n\n**Article IV(3)**: At the time of submission, the NCL is currently at 350 million ADA and there are less than 300 million ADA in approved budgets. We believe that this removes a potential constitutional barrier for this proposal based on Article IV(3), since this proposal requests 50 million ADA.\n\n**Article IV(4)**: We budget 275,000 ADA for construction of a smart contract and appropriate audits for the smart contract used to administer funds. The nature of the proposal requires liquidity to be held in the contract in order to make auditing by the community easy, since a single address will hold the total liquidity of the fund. Since the fund is designed to exist in perpetuity (with safeguards to shut down the fund through community action), specific budget to audit the fund are not specifically included but can be proposed and approved by the community and paid by the revenue of the fund.\n\n**Article IV Section 5**: The nature of the proposed work fulfills the first requirement of Article IV(5) of the constitution. The holding of all assets in the smart contract composed of 9 independent signers improves the ability of the Cardano community to easily audit and track actions taken by the committee. To fulfill the second part of the section, funds will not be delegated to an SPO and will be delegated to the predefined auto-abstain voting option.\n\n**TREASURY-04a**: There is no on chain withdrawal action for this budget, and one will not be submitted unless this budget achieves the necessary approval.","metadata_motivation":"### Overview\n\n* **Amount** 50 million ADA is requested for a budget period of 12 months. Up to 500,000 ADA will be used to establish a legal framework for the fund and create a smart contract with executive and oversight functions. The remaining 49.5 million ADA will be dedicated to funding Cardano DeFi protocols. Up to 35% of the fund will remain in ADA to pair with stablecoins on DEXs, and the remainder will be dedicated to minting stablecoins.  \n* **Administration**  The fund will be administered in a smart contract with a 9 person committee that will require 5 signatures to spend funds. The tDAO (made up of a broad snapshot of dReps) will have oversight functions including the ability to impeach and elect committee members as well as temporarily or permanently prevent spend actions other than sending funds back to the treasury. The administrating committee will be responsible for working with 3rd party exchanges or trading desks to convert ADA to fiat backed stablecoins and then deploying to defi protocols (i.e. DEX and lending protocols).   \n* **Revenue**  Funds deployed in DeFi protocols will earn revenue, and once a month 15% of revenue will be converted to ADA and sent back to the treasury while 85% will remain in protocols to continue growing. ADA held by the committee that is not deployed will not be staked according to constitutional requirements (see Rationale for more information).  \n* **Deployment**  DeFi protocols may apply to be recipients of stablecoin liquidity, and the administrating committee will review and disburse funds to protocols that have the best plans for growth and returns back to the treasury. A maximum of 2 protocols may be used per DeFi category to minimize liquidity fragmentation. Applicants should make a strong case for the use of their protocol, including a a description of historical success, security, dedicated support for handling issues, a plan for attracting new liquidity, and features of the protocol that will maximize the value to the Cardano treasury if liquidity is deployed to the protocol. New protocols will not be excluded for having limited history, but must make a strong case in other areas of the application.  \n* **Audits and Transparency**  The committee is responsible for creating a monthly report on the funds deployed to protocols and all fees and other costs associated with managing the treasury. All liquidity tokens must be held in the governing smart contract to permit public auditing of funds.  \n* **Costs**  Each member of the committee will be compensated $1,000/month in ADA or the fiat backed stablecoin of their choice ($9,000/month total for all committee members). Compensation for committee members is for their time monitoring funds and the need to be available at any time to take action. The stablecoin reserve fund will cover the costs of minting fiat backed stables, deployment of liquidity to protocols, and rebalancing as needed. Intermittent costs of managing the fund including legal fees after initial legal setup (legal disputes, regulatory issues, etc), audits, KYB/KYC due diligence and other costs may be paid for by the fund. The committee will broadcast any unexpected costs to the community and detail it in the monthly report, and the tDAO may vote to shut down the fund if they deem costs to be excessive.  \n* **Lifetime & Revisions**  The funds from this proposal are intended to remain in ownership of the Cardano community and managed by the committee. It is designed to live in perpetuity, but can be shut down at any time by the tDAO. The committee will follow the directive for the fund described in the Governance Protocol (see supplemental links), which focuses on stablecoins and growing liquidity.\n\n### Why Does Cardano Need Stablecoin Liquidity?\n\nThere is a strong need for better liquidity, especially stablecoin liquidity, in the Cardano ecosystem. Deep stablecoin liquidity helps to serve as an on/off board mechanism for new users as well as a safe haven from market volatility. The Cardano community as a whole benefits from deep stablecoin liquidity, and thus it makes sense to bootstrap this liquidity with funds from the Cardano treasury. In addition to providing mechanisms to onboard new users, deeper liquidity in decentralized exchanges will help stablecoins keep their peg since the stablecoin peg is a function of exchange fees and slippage, where slippage is inversely proportional to liquidity. Put another way, the more liquidity a stablecoin has, the tighter it can maintain its peg.\n\nAs liquidity is bootstrapped, a positive feedback loop will be created, bringing more professional market makers on chain. We see this consistently in traditional finance and in other blockchain ecosystems. Market Makers are more willing to quote tighter spreads and provide more liquidity into an asset once there is sufficient liquidity in that asset. Liquidity begets liquidity. This will also spur more DeFi innovation, bring more developers and retail participation into the Cardano ecosystem, and benefit everyone involved in Cardano.\n\n### Why Fiat Backed Stablecoins?\n\nStablecoins suffer from the 'stablecoin trilemma':\n\n* **Stability** – maintaining a reliable and resilient peg.  \n* **Decentralization** – avoiding reliance on centralized entities.  \n* **Capital Efficiency** – minimizing overcollateralization or complex mechanisms to back the stablecoin’s value. \n\nFiat backed stablecoins tend to be capital efficient (1 USD invested in Treasury Bills, money market funds, banks backs 1 stablecoin) and stable. However, these tend to be more centralized than collateralized debt positions (CDP) backed stablecoins and algorithmic stablecoins. Given the desire to deepen on chain liquidity and create a thriving ecosystem, fiat backed stablecoins make the most sense from a capital efficiency standpoint (especially given their dominance in other thriving blockchain ecosystems).\n\n### Consideration of ADA Price Impact\n\nTreasury funds are in ADA, and must be liquidated to USD in order to mint fiat backed stablecoins. A valid concern with this proposal is the conversion of ADA to USD having a major price impact. It is important to remember that the full 50 million ADA will not be liquidated for stablecoins, since a portion (up to 35%) will need to remain as ADA to pair with stablecoins on DEXs. However, that still leaves a significant sum of ADA that needs to be liquidated for conversion to fiat backed stablecoins.\n\nThere are many mechanisms by which ADA can be liquidated, including direct sales to TradFi funds and OTC deals where ADA will never directly hit the open market to even have a price impact. Other methods include dollar cost averaging and other strategies to gently liquidate ADA so as not to induce a price shock. Even though the ADA liquidation will not be directly sold on an exchange, we want to include an analysis to show what the impact might look like if it were. Looking at only Coinbase ADA volume (the 4th largest ADA exchange by volume), for the last 3 months Coinbase has had an average daily volume of 30 million ADA. This means we could sell 500,000 ADA per day for 65 days to have all the liquidity needed for minting stablecoins, and this volume would represent 1.6% of the daily volume on the 4th largest ADA exchange. Spreading out sales of ADA combined with use of other CEXs (such as Binance, which has even higher daily volumes) would further reduce price impact. Thus, even not accounting for OTC deals and other mechanisms, the amounts of ADA being converted to USD make up a small fraction of daily CEX volume and thus should not have a major impact on ADA price.\n\n### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)\n\n#### 50% Reduction in Stablecoin Slippage\n\nThe primary goal of this proposal is to increase the depth of stablecoin liquidity, and one measure of deeper liquidity on Cardano is reduced slippage. Since slippage is also tied to the size of the order, we use a $100,000 purchase as the benchmark (at $0.9 ADA price, enough to purchase ADA for an info action deposit). For USDM, the current slippage is 4% of USDM and 6% for USDA.\n\n#### 4% Annual Returns to the Treasury\n\nThe primary motive of this project is to increase the depth of liquidity to the Cardano ecosystem, but revenue will naturally be generated from liquidity provision. We expect 4% returns back to the treasury based on the current market conditions for lending yields and DEX liquidity provision assuming a small increase in transaction volume. We believe based on analysis that an increase in volume will follow an increase in TVL since volume and TVL tend to be correlated, so 4% annual returns are a reasonable target.\n\n### Public Goods\n\nThis proposal not only seeks to deploy treasury funds for the good of the Cardano blockchain and create a sustainable source of revenue, but will also create additional benefits for the ecosystem. In particular, the legal structure developed here will help to establish a framework for future proposals that seek similar structure that include executive actions from a committee or board with community oversight. Further, the development of the smart contract to functionally implement such a structure will be open sourced and openly available to the entire community to make use of.","metadata_references":"[{\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Administrating Contract (Google Docs)\", \"uri\": \"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wbiz4fi3lRxLSXGv3p7pNMCKxEykVbjZ-Korso8YijU/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.bfmvvshwjurt\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Administrating Contract (Markdown)\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafkreiefjxbzyjpcakpgstzsmzllvz3heelwo7wrmhv4tw24otf73s56ye\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Governance Protocol (Google Docs)\", \"uri\": \"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-z10BIl_0Z2SiCpQMaPvpbQQ8p8fVTpC8S3QRU9JpaU/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.ml0ar6tdt627\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Governance Protocol (Markdown)\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafkreif6sjnhz5am4bdvhk7726kuygthn3rytjcic4kf42zgej7pok7tl4\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Interim Committee (Google Docs)\", \"uri\": \"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hG1ZW5-E8XwoaT7WAXpa_515545wPl4fiWvWxN4wGX0/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.kjz9j4vo2ks0\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Interim Committee (Markdown)\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafkreiefbcwgu6d6lixrpycsp6eypxo56axveavahhwieukywb76ie6c6i\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Smart Contract Development RFP (Google Docs)\", \"uri\": \"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U2EW_dxc91xGxS2RxSaLqQT5S-804de6-MYV5mMFO7Q/edit?tab=t.0\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Smart Contract Development RFP (Markdown)\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafkreice6dxce377l5basug7zpolur7i2s42nygatbuijcsknqb5w5v2hu\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Smart Contract Audit RFP (Google Docs)\", \"uri\": \"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BhDtli0tvDwIS1sz4Nrh72EbbGjOAch0LJztI72Wmwc/edit?tab=t.0\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Smart Contract Audit RFP (Markdown)\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafkreigbk4q4vf3ymke5dyhjmhmqtp2cu3z3vjkhc6fs47pmfp3jyb3p6u\"}]","metadata_resolved":1,"metadata_hash_valid":1,"proposer_address":"","param_changes":null,"treasury_amount_lovelace":null,"treasury_recipients":null,"flags":"[{\"flag\": \"\\ud83d\\udfe1 NO_DISCUSSION\", \"severity\": \"yellow\", \"score\": 3, \"detail\": \"No links to forum discussion or community feedback\"}]","flag_score":3,"first_seen":"2026-02-09T18:50:25.950966+00:00","last_updated":"2026-02-09T22:00:01.543836+00:00"},

This proposal is the **first-ever loan-based treasury withdrawal** in Cardano governance, introducing a new model of accountability where funds are not given as grants but repaid with interest.\n\nAs part of the governance process, a Board of Advisors will be appointed to ensure transparent execution and maximize ecosystem alignment. This board will include high-profile industry veterans like Tal Cohen (former CEO of Kraken), Phillip Pon (CEO of Emurgo), Fahmi Syed (President of Midnight Foundation), and Frederik Gregaard (CEO of Cardano Foundation), with additional top-tier names to be announced.\n\n*SNEK is the largest community token on Cardano, holding the highest market capitalization, over 42,000 wallets, and more than 2 billion ADA in all-time trading volume.*\n\nOver the past two years, the Snek Foundation has already invested over $4.5 million, entirely self-funded, to secure major exchange listings. Snek delivered the first, second, and third-ever Tier 1 listings for any Cardano native token, with Kraken, Crypto.com, and Kucoin, setting historic precedents for the ecosystem. With this proposal and with the support of our partners, we aim to unlock greater visibility, liquidity, and accessibility for the broader Cardano ecosystem by leveraging SNEK's proven momentum and market position.\n\nThis loan will be repaid from Snek product revenues and business ventures with the final balance plus interest settled in three to five years, following a closing audit to confirm the loan has been repaid in full. Interest is set at 2.44% annualized (2.37% staking rate + 0.07%), compounded yearly.\n\nBy structuring this as a repayable loan, the Snek Foundation is once again trailblazing for the ecosystem; demonstrating how treasury capital can be deployed responsibly while setting a precedent for future projects. The administrator of the budget funds will be Intersect.","metadata_rationale":"## Executive summary\n\nThe [SNEK](https://www.snek.com/) Global Exchange Expansion initiative will execute a targeted listing strategy, using the requested 5M ADA to:\n\n- Finalize negotiations and secure multiple top-tier listings on centralized exchanges, retail brokers, and innovative DeFi platforms\n\n- Provision liquidity and market making for ADA/SNEK pairs\n\n- Cover legal and compliance costs to meet exchange requirements\n\n- Fund mandatory coordination and announcement campaigns\n\n- Report expenditures and impact transparently to the community\n\n### Ecosystem Benefits:\n\n- **Increase ADA liquidity across global trading platforms:** Listings will establish deep liquidity for ADA/SNEK pairs and reinforce ADA's role as a quote asset in broader markets.\n\n- **Expand Cardano visibility among mainstream users:** Presence on Tier 1 CEXs and retail platforms will increase Cardano's exposure where most crypto adoption begins.\n\n- **Establish reusable exchange infrastructure for CNTs:** This initiative creates the legal, technical, and operational framework that future Cardano tokens can leverage.\n\n- **Lay the technical and legal groundwork for future Cardano token listings:** This initiative solves the hardest and most expensive part of Tier 1 onboarding the integrations, KYC, and compliance infrastructure that every CNT would otherwise need to build from scratch. Once completed, this framework can be reused by future projects, massively reducing the technical lift required for Cardano wide exchange access.\n\n- **Drive user acquisition through proven community traction:** Snek's viral momentum helps Cardano tap into the same memecoin fueled onboarding funnels that propelled DOGE and SHIB.\n\n- **Create liquidity bridges for DeFi, NFTs, L2s, and dApps:** Expanded listings make it easier to onboard capital and users into Cardano-native protocols:\n\n- **Document and share listing playbooks with the ecosystem:** All compliance, negotiation, and integration learnings will be captured and shared with the Cardano Foundation and other token teams to accelerate future listings.\n\n### Cardano Treasury and Governance:\n\n- High ROI use of funds by leveraging SNEK as a magnet for adoption\n\n- Support of a community-run initiative with a proven track record\n\n- Back a team that has already invested more than $4.5 million of its own capital into this initiative, and remains committed to continued investment alongside community support.\n\nThe loan will only be used to cover necessary expenses to achieve key listings.\n\nThese costs can vary from one listing to another, but generally include:\n\n- Listing Fees\n\n- Liquidity Provisioning\n\n- Legal & Compliance\n\n- Marketing & Campaign budgets (led by the exchanges)\n\n- Advisory & Transparency Ops\n\nThis loan will be repaid continuously to the treasury from Snek network activities and settled in full after no longer than 5 years from the reception of the funds.\n\n## Loan terms\n\n**Principal:** 5 million ADA\n\n**Interest Rate:** 2.44% APR The loan will accrue interest at the current average Cardano staking rewards rate of 2.37% per year, plus an additional 0.07% as a gesture of good faith\n\n**Repayment Timeline:** Repayments will be made continuously to the Cardano Treasury through multiple ways, including but not limited to: Snek product revenues and business ventures, with direct payments coming from the Snek Foundation treasury. Early payments may begin at any time and loan repayment must commence no later than the last day of year 3.\n\n**Audit & Review:** At the end of year 3, an independent audit will be conducted to review the repayments already made. The audit will verify the amounts reimbursed to date, calculate any outstanding principal and interest, and establish a repayment schedule to ensure the full balance is repaid over the remaining years.\n\n**Default & Enforcement:** In the unlikely event of non-repayment, the obligation will remain enforceable under the binding loan agreement administered by Intersect on behalf of the Treasury. Remedies and next steps would follow the terms of that contract.\n\n**Loan Maturity:** The full loan (principal + interest) must be repaid in full within 5 years from the date of disbursement.\n\n## Administration of the loan\n\nThe administrator of the budget funds will be Intersect, offering continuous oversight. Expenditures will be tracked against the stated use of funds, with reporting, receipts, and independent audits ensuring that spending remains aligned with the proposal's objectives. This approach provides the flexibility required to execute global listings while still offering the Treasury transparent, phased accountability.\n\nAdditionally, a Board of Advisors will be appointed to provide guidance, feedback, and external validation.\n\n**The board will include:**\n\n- Tal Cohen, former CEO of Kraken\n\n- Frederik Gregaard, CEO of Cardano Foundation\n\n- Phillip Pon, CEO of Emurgo\n\n- Fahmi Syed, President of Midnight Foundation\n\n- Rapha C-Roy, CEO of Snek Foundation\n\n**The board's responsibilities:**\n\n- Advise key expenses\n\n- Guide negotiations and legal strategy\n\n- Ensure alignment with Cardano treasury goals\n\n- Ensure outcomes benefit the Cardano ecosystem beyond SNEK\n\n- Support documentation and distribution of listing playbooks to future Cardano-native token teams\n\nThis structure ensures that the project benefits from experienced external input while maintaining decentralized, community-led control over treasury execution.\n\nThe Board will also help facilitate knowledge sharing across the ecosystem by supporting documentation of listing procedures, exchange engagement strategy, and compliance best practices, enabling other Cardano native projects to benefit from this groundwork.\n\nAn allocation of 30-50k ADA per year will be reserved out of the 5M for yearly independent external audit reports, ensuring that the loan is transparently monitored and fully accountable to the Treasury.\n\n## Reporting\n\n#### Bi-Yearly Reports\n\nSnek Foundation will publish bi-yearly updates including:\n\n- Progress on exchange listings\n\n- Funds spent with receipts when allowed\n\n- All legal/compliance materials will be open-sourced when possible\n\n- Learnings from legal, compliance, and integration processes\n\n- Results of independent external audits\n\n#### Knowledge Sharing\n\nAll listing playbooks, integration frameworks, and documentation will be made available to the Cardano Foundation, Emurgo, IOG, and future token teams. Progress will be shared during regular Cardano town halls and across governance channels to maintain transparency and feedback loops to the best of our ability and within contractual regulations.\n\n#  \n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe Snek Foundation has already proven its commitment to Cardano, investing over $4.5M of its own funds into the exact initiative now being proposed for co-funding. This request is not about raising capital for a single token; it is about funding infrastructure, visibility, and adoption for the entire Cardano ecosystem.\n\nThis is not a grant; it is a loan, to be repaid in full with interest, demonstrating our commitment to accountability and sustainability. With dedicated budget allocations for independent audits and transparent reporting, the Treasury will be able to monitor progress, repayments, and compliance throughout the loan term, ensuring this initiative delivers both measurable impact and accountability.\n\n[SNEK](https://www.snek.com/) is currently the only Cardano-native asset that meets Tier 1 exchange requirements.\n\nSupporting this proposal unlocks:\n\n- Immediate listings with global reach\n\n- Deep ADA pair liquidity\n\n- Repeatable frameworks for future CNTs\n\nThe time to act is now.\n\nThe market is receptive, Snek has momentum, and the Cardano ecosystem is ready to scale its visibility. This proposal is how we turn years of effort into lasting, reusable infrastructure.\n\n## Constitutionality checklist\n\n#### Purpose\n\n- This proposal is for work intended to enhance the security, decentralization and long-term sustainability of Cardano.\n\n#### Article III.5: the process of on-chain governance\n\n- Proposal is submitted in a legible, standardized format and includes rationale, budget, administration plan, and reporting framework.\n\n#### Article IV.1: proposing budgets\n\n- This proposal supports Cardano blockchain adoption, liquidity, and token infrastructure.\n\n#### Article IV.2: funds administration\n\n- This proposal specifies an administrator in accordance with this provision. The budget is administered and documented by a named party (Intersect), with oversight of an off-chain committee (board of trusted advisors).\n\n#### Article IV.3: Net-Change Limit\n\n- Being of ₳5M and covering the second half of 2025, this proposal and the treasury withdrawals it would enable do not violate the currently agreed upon Net-Change Limit.\n\n#### Article IV.4: Auditor\n\n- This proposal makes provisions for an auditor: An allocation of 30-50k ADA per year will be reserved for yearly independent external audit reports, ensuring that the loan is transparently monitored and fully accountable to the Treasury.\n\n#### Guardrails\n\n- This proposal is subject to TREASURY-04a in that it defines a Cardano blockchain ecosystem budget. It requires a threshold greater than 50% of the DReps' active voting stake to be considered approved and enable subsequent withdrawals pertaining to this budget.","metadata_motivation":"## Who we are\n\nSnek Foundation is a grassroots organization responsible for launching and maintaining the SNEK ecosystem. Snek has never raised external funds for exchange listings and has operated for the past 29 months, entirely self-funded through its revenue and treasury.\n\nSo far, more than $ 4.5 million has been invested by the Snek Foundation towards listing activities.\n\n**Since May 2023, Snek has:**\n\n- 42,000+ wallets holding SNEK --- the most actively held token on Cardano\n\n- 2,000,000,000 ADA in all-time trading volume --- the most traded token on Cardano\n\n- SNEK is the most well-known token in and out of the Cardano ecosystem, with 30 markets\n\n- Self-funded $4.5M for exchange listing activities\n\n- Delivered the three first-ever Tier 1 exchange listings for Cardano via Kraken, Crypto.com, and Kucoin.\n\n- Developed the first-ever CEX-DEX market-making service with Flowdesk\n\n- Launched Snek.fun, Cardano's leading launchpad, driving over 30% of all chain trades since inception\n\n- Trademarked brand with ongoing IP licensing deals (Snek Figures, Snek Energy)\n\nThe team has a successful track record negotiating listings, building tools, and driving global meme adoption aligned with Cardano's values.\n\n## Why this proposal matters\n\nSNEK is Cardano's most adopted token, yet it remains underrepresented on major centralized exchanges, reflecting a broader lack of visibility for Cardano on mainstream platforms and among broader audiences.\n\nThis underrepresentation doesn't just affect SNEK. It weakens Cardano's position in competitive markets and slows ecosystem-wide growth in four key areas:\n\n1.  ADA's visibility and liquidity on global platforms\n\n2.  Cardano's competitiveness in retail-driven market cycles\n\n3.  The discoverability of Cardano's ecosystem by mainstream users\n\n4.  CNT adoption and the path for other tokens to reach similar success\n\nCardano currently lacks a flagship token that drives liquidity, virality, and culture across exchange listings, just like DOGE, SHIBA, and PEPE do for Ethereum and Solana.\n\nSNEK has already shown it can fill this role; now it needs support to break through at scale.\n\n**This proposal aims to address the following challenges:**\n\n- **Lack of exchange presence for Cardano native tokens:** Most major centralized exchanges and retail brokers still do not support Cardano Native Tokens (CNTs). This severely limits Cardano's accessibility and competitiveness on a global scale. While Ethereum and Solana ecosystems enjoy deep integrations with top exchanges, Cardano-native projects are left with fewer liquidity pathways and less discoverability. Until CNTs are more visible on mainstream platforms, Cardano's on-chain economy cannot reach its full potential.\n\n- **Low visibility for ADA pairings:** Centralized exchanges are the primary entry point for millions of users, yet ADA trading pairs are underrepresented relative to Cardano's market cap. Without community-driven assets like SNEK creating demand for ADA pairings, liquidity remains shallow and volume muted. This proposal helps bootstrap those pairings, supporting deeper ADA liquidity and reinforcing Cardano's relevance at the trading layer.\n\n- **Missed user acquisition:** In other ecosystems, memecoins like SHIB, DOGE, and PEPE have served as cultural gateways for millions of new retail users. These tokens create stories, engagement, and participation, driving demand for the base layer tokens and ecosystem tools. SNEK has proven it can play that role for Cardano. Without support to elevate its accessibility, Cardano risks missing this powerful user acquisition funnel.\n\n- **Liquidity fragmentation:** Cardano's DeFi protocols face high barriers to liquidity aggregation due to the lack of bridgeable, on-ramp-compatible assets. Without listings on major exchanges, Cardano native assets remain siloed and isolated from the broader crypto capital flows, limiting scalability and adoption.\n\nBy funding this initiative, Cardano positions itself to solve these bottlenecks through a trusted, culturally strong and community-proven asset that can serve as a gateway for users and liquidity.\n\nToday, Snek is the only Cardano-native token capable of meeting Tier 1 exchange requirements. This makes it the best and currently only viable gateway to unlock the access, liquidity, and visibility Cardano needs at the global level.\n\nThe goal is not exclusivity --- it's scalability. By leading the way through Snek, we create a repeatable path for other CNTs to follow. The foundation has already begun sharing its knowledge with other projects post-Kraken, and through this proposal, will continue building and systematizing resources that can be shared with Cardano Foundation, Emurgo, and IOG.","metadata_references":"[{\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Snek Foundation (Website)\", \"uri\": \"https://www.snek.com/\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Snek Foundation (X)\", \"uri\": \"https://x.com/snek\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Rapha C-Roy, CEO @ Snek Foundation\", \"uri\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/in/raphacroy/\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Tal Cohen, former CEO of Kraken\", \"uri\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/in/talcohenprofile/\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Frederik Gregaard, CEO of Cardano Foundation\", \"uri\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregaard/\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Phillip Pon, CEO of Emurgo\", \"uri\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/in/phillip-pon-89666a2/\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Fahmi Syed, President of Midnight Foundation\", \"uri\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/in/fahmi-s-694b5414b/\"}]","metadata_resolved":1,"metadata_hash_valid":1,"proposer_address":"","param_changes":null,"treasury_amount_lovelace":null,"treasury_recipients":null,"flags":"[{\"flag\": \"\\ud83d\\udfe1 NO_DISCUSSION\", \"severity\": \"yellow\", \"score\": 3, \"detail\": \"No links to forum discussion or community feedback\"}]","flag_score":3,"first_seen":"2026-02-09T18:50:25.950966+00:00","last_updated":"2026-02-09T22:00:01.543836+00:00"},

By investing in people (capacity building and community), projects (hackathons and pilots), and promotion (marketing and storytelling), we create a virtuous cycle: more talent and awareness leads to more projects, which lead to real adoption and success stories, which in turn attract even more talent and partnerships. This aligns closely with Cardano’s mission of building a world-changing ecosystem – starting locally in Oceania, with ripples globally.","metadata_rationale":"\n## Executive summary\n\nCardano in Oceania will deliver a practical engine for adoption by building a regional business-development track — training and mentoring local advocates, aligning efforts with global ecosystem teams, and pursuing real pilots with enterprises, startups, academia, and public agencies. In parallel, it will map the people, projects, and capabilities across the region into an interactive network, then use that map to convene roundtables, spot gaps, and actively match talent to opportunities so Cardano projects ship faster.\n\nMomentum comes from hands-on community activation and clear storytelling: a stronger presence at major tech events, a flagship hackathon, a cadence of local meetups and governance workshops, and an integrated marketing push that empowers community content creators, surfaces regional case studies, and localises outreach for Oceania audiences. Together, these streams turn strategy into visible outcomes and a repeatable model other regions can adopt.\n\nWe request that DReps and other assessors review the full details of our strategic plan, which includes the program of work, budget breakdown, milestones and KPIs, available at https://cardano-in-oceania.github.io. To ensure the immutability of the content on this website, the hash of the Git commit for the markdown and other files used to build the website (using the GitHub Pages feature) is available in the “References” section of this metadata and in the footer of the website. By including the website hash in this metadata, it is included as part of generating the metadata hash submitted with this governance action on-chain.\n\n## Amount\n\nThe total amount requested through this budget is 778,000 ada.\n\n## Administration of the Cardano Funds\n\nThe administration of funds for this proposal will be conducted in a transparent, accountable, and constitutionally aligned manner. To ensure proper oversight, the following processes and roles are defined:\n\n\n### Administrator\n\nThe budget will be administered by **selfdriven Services**, acting in good faith on behalf of the Cardano community. The administrator will manage disbursements, verify milestone evidence, and uphold the principles of fairness and transparency. All administration activities will be traceable, with references to GitHub commits and IPFS hashes to guarantee immutability.\n\n### Milestone Processing\n\nFunds will be released on a milestone-by-milestone basis. For each milestone, the proposer must submit clear evidence of completion to the GitHub repository maintained by selfdriven Services. Evidence may include documentation, educational resources, participation data, or other relevant deliverables. Milestones will be processed efficiently, and funds will not be unduly withheld once requirements have been met.\n\n### Dispute Resolution\n\nIn the event of disagreement regarding milestone delivery, determinations made by the selfdriven Services Financial Administrator will be considered final and binding in the first instance. However, proposers retain the right to escalate disputes to the Cardano community by submitting an Info-Action to the DReps, including all relevant evidence. If more than 50% of DReps vote in favour of the appeal, the administrator will recognise this decision and co-sign the transaction accordingly. This ensures that ultimate oversight remains with the decentralised governance process, in line with the Constitution.\n\n### Cardano Addresses\n\n* Treasury funds will be received into addresses specifically designated for this proposal. To safeguard neutrality and accountability:\n* The addresses will be delegated to the **Auto-Abstain DRep**, ensuring they are not used to influence governance decisions.\nThey will also remain **unstaked to any Stake Pool Operator (SPO)**, ensuring that funds cannot generate staking rewards or confer advantage to specific pools.\n\nThrough these measures, administration of the budget ensures that funds are responsibly managed, that milestones are verifiable and tied to real outcomes, and that disputes can be resolved transparently within Cardano’s governance framework.\nMore information about selfdriven Services is available at https://selfdriven.services.  A link to the document and hash available in the Reference.\n\n## Reporting\n\nAll reporting for this initiative will be conducted in a transparent, open, and verifiable manner, directly tied to the obligations and milestone processes outlined above.\n\n### Milestone Evidence\n\nIn accordance with the Processing of Milestones obligation, evidence for each milestone will be submitted to the GitHub repository maintained by selfdriven Services. This evidence will include reports, educational materials, event records, governance engagement summaries, and other outputs relevant to the stated objectives.\n\n### Frequency of Reports\n\nReports will be provided at the completion of each milestone. Each report will contain:\n* A description of activities undertaken and alignment with the proposal’s objectives.\n* A summary of outcomes, including metrics such as participation numbers, partnerships formed, or educational content delivered.\n* Links and hashes to all supporting evidence, stored in GitHub and/or IPFS.\n* A financial statement showing allocation and expenditure for the reporting period.\n* Community Oversight.\n\nReports will be made publicly available, enabling the Cardano community to review and provide feedback. Any disputes regarding reported outcomes will follow the Dispute Resolution process described earlier, whereby appeals may be made through the DReps Info-Action mechanism.\n\n### Auditing\n\nIn alignment with Article IV.4 of the Constitution, provision is made for an independent auditor to verify reporting accuracy, compliance with milestones, and adherence to governance principles.\n\n## Constitutionality checklist\n\n### Purpose\n\nThis proposal establishes a **community-led** regional budget that catalyses real-world Cardano adoption throughout Oceania — standing up a business-development track, mapping and convening the ecosystem, and scaling hands-on community engagement, governance, and education. The goal is to deepen decentralisation and inclusion while turning strategy into visible, real-world pilots and a **repeatable model** other regions can adapt for sustainable, long-term growth.\n\n### Article III.5: The process of on-chain governance\n\n* The proposal has been submitted in a standardised, legible format.\n* All supporting documentation is published with URLs and hashes (GitHub commits and IPFS references) to ensure immutability and verifiability.\n* The proposal includes a clear title, abstract, rationale, and supporting materials sufficient for governance decision-making.\n\n### Article IV.2: Funds administration\n\n* An administrator (selfdriven Services) is specified, fulfilling the requirements of this provision.\n* The proposal defines an internal process for fund administration using milestone submissions, dispute resolution mechanisms, and transparent reporting, all consistent with decentralised governance principles.\n\n### Article IV.3: Net-Change Limit\n\n* The requested amount does not exceed the current Net-Change Limit.\n* Treasury withdrawals under this budget are therefore constitutional and compliant with the safeguard against excessive expenditure.\n\n### Article IV.4: Auditor\n\n* The proposal makes provision for an independent auditor to verify milestone evidence and financial accountability.\n* This ensures compliance with constitutional audit requirements.\n\n### Guardrails\n\n* This proposal is subject to TREASURY-04a, as it defines a Cardano blockchain ecosystem budget.\n* Approval requires a threshold of >50% of the DReps’ active voting stake.\n* Once approved, subsequent withdrawals pertaining to this budget will proceed only in accordance with the reporting, obligation, and dispute resolution processes set out in this proposal.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCardano in Oceania represents a forward-looking investment in decentralisation, inclusion, and sustainability. By extending Cardano’s reach into Oceania, this initiative strengthens the network’s global resilience, broadens representation in governance, and builds durable structures for education and collaboration.\n\n### This proposal embeds accountability and constitutional alignment through:\n\n* Obligations that define responsibilities for milestone delivery.\n* Milestone Processing that ensures evidence is submitted, reviewed, and publicly verifiable.\n* Dispute Resolution that offers community-based appeals via DReps.\n* Reporting that ensures transparency and financial accountability.\n* Auditing that provides an independent safeguard.\n\nTogether, these mechanisms provide a strong framework of checks and balances. By approving this budget, the Cardano community affirms its commitment to an inclusive and globally distributed ecosystem, ensuring Oceania’s voices, talents, and ideas contribute to Cardano’s long-term growth and success.","metadata_motivation":"This initiative is aligned with the principles of the Cardano Constitution and directly contributes to the network’s growth and adoption. By expanding Cardano’s presence in Oceania, the project strengthens decentralisation, reduces reliance on specific geographic regions, and enhances the network’s global resilience.\n\nOceania provides a unique and valuable testbed for piloting community-driven growth and adoption strategies. Its diversity of cultures, economies, and geographies allows for experimentation with scalable models of grassroots activation that can later be replicated in other regions worldwide. By engaging local communities, universities, businesses, and civic organisations, Cardano in Oceania demonstrates how decentralised technologies can deliver tangible impact at the community level.\n\nThis initiative promotes inclusion by welcoming underrepresented voices into Cardano’s governance and innovation processes, making the ecosystem more diverse and representative. It ensures transparency by openly publishing plans, progress, and evidence, reinforcing accountability and trust. It fosters collaboration by linking developers, educators, and enthusiasts locally with the broader global Cardano community, in line with the Constitution’s call for cooperative, community-driven development.\n\nFinally, it prioritises sustainability by investing in durable community structures, education programs, and partnerships that will support Cardano’s growth and adoption for generations to come.\n\n**In short, Oceania is where Cardano can prove that decentralised, community-driven growth and adoption works.**","metadata_references":"[{\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Strategic Plan Website (Git Commit Hash: 1ae5f51eadc7a6b8def18a169791280284111340)\", \"uri\": \"https://cardano-in-oceania.github.io\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Strategic Plan Website - GitHub Repository Commit\", \"uri\": \"https://github.com/cardano-in-oceania/cardano-in-oceania.github.io/tree/1ae5f51eadc7a6b8def18a169791280284111340\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"selfdriven Services \\u2013 Cardano Governance Administration Services\", \"uri\": \"https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafybeicyhy4hfmy72xrnpalqhe4zn4xz4lpqtzvlc4qdgs6lhjhkteum6u\"}]","metadata_resolved":1,"metadata_hash_valid":1,"proposer_address":"","param_changes":null,"treasury_amount_lovelace":null,"treasury_recipients":null,"flags":"[]","flag_score":0,"first_seen":"2026-02-09T18:50:25.950966+00:00","last_updated":"2026-02-09T22:00:01.543836+00:00"},

SNEK is the largest community token on Cardano, holding the highest market capitalization, over 42,000 wallets, and more than 2 billion ADA in all-time trading volume. \n\nOver the past two years, the Snek Foundation has already invested over $4 million, entirely self funded, to secure major exchange listings. We’ve delivered the first and second ever Tier 1 listings for any Cardano native token, with Kraken and Crypto.com setting historic precedents for the ecosystem. These were not isolated wins, but the first step in a broader strategy to unlock global market access for Cardano.\n\nThis proposal seeks 5,000,000 ADA to support top-tier exchange listings, liquidity provisioning, legal and compliance services, and strategic advisory oversight. These listings will not only increase SNEK adoption but also bring unprecedented visibility, liquidity, and user acquisition opportunities to the entire Cardano ecosystem. As part of the governance process, a Board of Advisors will be appointed to ensure transparent execution and maximize ecosystem alignment. This board will include high-profile industry veterans like Tal Cohen (former CEO of Kraken) and Phillip Pon (CEO of Emurgo), with additional top-tier names to be announced.\n\nSNEK is Cardano’s most adopted token, yet it remains underrepresented on major centralized exchanges, reflecting a broader lack of visibility for Cardano on mainstream platforms and among broader audiences.\n\nThis underrepresentation doesn’t just affect SNEK. It weakens Cardano’s position in competitive markets and slows ecosystem-wide growth in four key areas:\n- ADA’s visibility and liquidity on global platforms\n- Cardano’s competitiveness in retail-driven market cycles\n- The discoverability of Cardano’s ecosystem by mainstream users\n- CNT adoption and the path for other tokens to reach similar success\n\nCardano currently lacks a flagship token that drives liquidity, virality, and culture across exchange listings, just like DOGE, SHIBA, and PEPE do for Ethereum and Solana.\nSNEK has already shown it can fill this role; now it needs support to break through at scale.","metadata_rationale":"## Project Solution\n\nThe SNEK Global Exchange Expansion initiative will execute a targeted listing strategy, using the requested 5M ADA to:\n- Finalize negotiations and secure multiple top-tier listings on centralized exchanges, retail brokers, and innovative DeFi platforms\n- Provision liquidity and market making for ADA/SNEK pairs\n- Cover legal and compliance costs to meet exchange requirements\n- Fund mandatory coordination and announcement campaigns\n- Report expenditures and impact transparently to the community\n\nEcosystem Benefits:\n\n- **Increase ADA liquidity across global trading platforms:** Listings will establish deep liquidity for ADA/SNEK pairs and reinforce ADA’s role as a quote asset in broader markets.\n\n- **Expand Cardano visibility among mainstream users:** Presence on Tier 1 CEXs and retail platforms will increase Cardano’s exposure where most crypto adoption begins.\n\n- **Establish reusable exchange infrastructure for CNTs:** This initiative creates the legal, technical, and operational framework that future Cardano tokens can leverage.\n\n- **Lay the technical and legal groundwork for future Cardano token listings:** This initiative solves the hardest and most expensive part of Tier 1 onboarding the integrations, KYC, and compliance infrastructure that every CNT would otherwise need to build from scratch. Once completed, this framework can be reused by future projects, massively reducing the technical lift required for Cardano wide exchange access.\n\n- **Drive user acquisition through proven community traction:** Snek’s viral momentum helps Cardano tap into the same memecoin fueled onboarding funnels that propelled DOGE and SHIB.\n\n- **Create liquidity bridges for DeFi, NFTs, L2s, and dApps:** Expanded listings make it easier to onboard capital and users into Cardano-native protocols:\n\n- **Document and share listing playbooks with the ecosystem:** All compliance, negotiation, and integration learnings will be captured and shared with the Cardano Foundation and other token teams to accelerate future listings.\n\nCardano Treasury and Governance:\n- High ROI use of funds by leveraging SNEK as a magnet for adoption\n- Support of a community-run initiative with a proven track record\n- Back a team that has already invested more than $4 million of its own capital into this initiative, and remains committed to continued investment alongside community support.\n\n## Listing Strategy\n\nThis proposal prioritizes high-impact, global-facing exchanges and service providers, with some already at the later stages for listing. Including but not limited to:\n\n- **Tier 1 & 2 CEXs:** Coinbase, Binance, Crypto.com, KuCoin, OKX, Upbit, HTX, Bybit\n\n- **Retail Brokers:** Robinhood, Revolut, MoonPay, eToro, Uphold\n\n- **Innovative DeFi:** Hyperliquid (for perpetuals and trading)\n\nThese platforms represent critical access points for onboarding new users, increasing ADA liquidity, and bringing Cardano native tokens into mainstream crypto finance.\n\nThis strategy marks the next step toward large-scale adoption of Cardano native assets (CNTs). We already have multiple offers under consideration, and access to a larger budget through this treasury proposal will allow us to negotiate more effectively, secure better placement, and maximize impact for the broader Cardano ecosystem.\n\n## Vendor Profile\n\nSnek Foundation is a grassroots organization responsible for launching and maintaining the SNEK ecosystem. Snek has never raised external funds for exchange listings and has operated for the past 29 months, entirely self-funded through its revenue and treasury.\n\nSince May 2023, Snek has:\n- 42,000+ wallets holding SNEK — the most actively held token on Cardano\n- 2,000,000,000 ADA in all-time trading volume — the most traded token on Cardano\n- SNEK is the most well-known token in and out of the Cardano ecosystem, with 30 markets\n- Self-funded $4M for exchange listings\n- Delivered the first and second-ever Tier 1 exchange listings for Cardano via Kraken and Crypto.com\n- Developed the first ever CEX-DEX market-making service with Flowdesk\n- Launched Snek.fun, Cardano’s leading launchpad, driving over 30% of all chain trades since inception\n- Trademarked brand with ongoing IP licensing deals (Snek Figures, Snek Energy)\n\nThe team has a successful track record negotiating listings, building tools, and driving global meme adoption aligned with Cardano’s values.\n\nThe goal is not exclusivity — it’s scalability. By leading the way through Snek, we create a repeatable path for other CNTs to follow. The foundation has already begun sharing its knowledge with other projects post-Kraken, and through this proposal, will continue building and systematizing resources that can be shared with Cardano Foundation, Emurgo, and IOG.\n\n## Governance and Oversight\n\nA Board of Advisors will be appointed to provide guidance, feedback, and external validation. The board will include:\n- Tal Cohen, former CEO of Kraken\n- Phillip Pon, CEO of Emurgo\n- Rapha C-Roy, CEO of Snek Foundation\n- Prominent leaders from the Cardano ecosystem and the compliance sector - more to come on this. \n\nThe board’s responsibilities:\n- Advise key expenses\n- Guide negotiations and legal strategy\n- Ensure alignment with Cardano treasury goals\n- Ensure outcomes benefit the Cardano ecosystem beyond SNEK\n- Support documentation and distribution of listing playbooks to future Cardano-native token teams\n\nThis structure ensures that the project benefits from experienced external input while maintaining decentralized, community-led control over treasury execution.\n\nThe Board will also help facilitate knowledge sharing across the ecosystem by supporting documentation of listing procedures, exchange engagement strategy, and compliance best practices, enabling other Cardano native projects to benefit from this groundwork.\n\n## Budget\n\nThe funds will only be used to cover necessary expenses to achieve key listings. These costs can vary from one listing to another, but generally include:\n- Listing Fees\n- Liquidity Provisioning\n- Legal & Compliance\n- Marketing & Campaign budgets (led by the exchanges)\n- Advisory & Transparency Ops\n\nAny unused funds will be returned to the treasury.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Snek Foundation has self funded the growth of SNEK to date, all prior centralized exchange listings, marketing, and infrastructure without relying on any community raise or token sale. Over the past two years, the Snek Foundation has invested more than $4 million USD into listings alone, funded entirely through project revenue and the Snek treasury.\n\nThis proposal marks the first time the Foundation is requesting support from the Cardano community to unlock broader exchange access, liquidity, and visibility for the entire Cardano ecosystem.\n\nBacking this initiative isn’t simply an investment in a single token. It’s a strategic investment in Cardano’s reach, relevance, and competitiveness in the global crypto landscape. SNEK has already proven itself as both a cultural and technical leader on Cardano and, more importantly, as a project that’s trusted to consistently deliver. With community support, we can continue to open doors that benefit every user, builder, and token in the ecosystem.\n\nThis proposal isn’t just about Snek — it’s about what Snek enables for Cardano. We’ve already proven that major platforms are willing to list CNTs when the right infrastructure, compliance, and community story are in place. With $4M+ of our own capital invested and Tier 1 listings already live, we’ve eliminated the risk and shown the upside. Now, with treasury support, we can go further — expanding access, sharing the roadmap, and giving every Cardano project the chance to follow.","metadata_motivation":"This proposal aims to address the following challenges:\n\n- **Lack of exchange presence for Cardano native tokens:** Most major centralized exchanges and retail brokers still do not support Cardano Native Tokens (CNTs). This severely limits Cardano’s accessibility and competitiveness on a global scale. While Ethereum and Solana ecosystems enjoy deep integrations with top exchanges, Cardano-native projects are left with fewer liquidity pathways and less discoverability. Until CNTs are more visible on mainstream platforms, Cardano’s on-chain economy cannot reach its full potential.\n\n- **Low visibility for ADA pairings:** Centralized exchanges are the primary entry point for millions of users, yet ADA trading pairs are underrepresented relative to Cardano’s market cap. Without community-driven assets like SNEK creating demand for ADA pairings, liquidity remains shallow and volume muted. This proposal helps bootstrap those pairings, supporting deeper ADA liquidity and reinforcing Cardano’s relevance at the trading layer.\n\n- **Missed user acquisition:** In other ecosystems, memecoins like SHIB, DOGE, and PEPE have served as cultural gateways for millions of new retail users. These tokens create stories, engagement, and participation, driving demand for the base layer tokens and ecosystem tools. SNEK has proven it can play that role for Cardano. Without support to elevate its accessibility, Cardano risks missing this powerful user acquisition funnel.\n\n- **Liquidity fragmentation:** Cardano’s DeFi protocols face high barriers to liquidity aggregation due to the lack of bridgeable, on-ramp-compatible assets. Without listings on major exchanges, Cardano native assets remain siloed and isolated from the broader crypto capital flows, limiting scalability and adoption.\n\nBy funding this initiative, Cardano positions itself to solve these bottlenecks through a trusted, culturally strong and community-proven asset that can serve as a gateway for users and liquidity.\n\nToday, Snek is the only Cardano-native token capable of meeting Tier 1 exchange requirements. This makes it the best and currently only viable gateway to unlock the access, liquidity, and visibility Cardano needs at the global level.","metadata_references":"[{\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Snek.com\", \"uri\": \"https://www.snek.com/\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"X\", \"uri\": \"https://x.com/snek\"}]","metadata_resolved":1,"metadata_hash_valid":1,"proposer_address":"","param_changes":null,"treasury_amount_lovelace":5000000000000,"treasury_recipients":"[{\"stake_address\": \"stake1uy5wxkqpezym2esqkgvw9yyqyd0rzuhkm206q6cddcxtqjgehj9ty\", \"amount\": \"5000000000000\"}]","flags":"[{\"flag\": \"\\ud83d\\udfe1 NO_DISCUSSION\", \"severity\": \"yellow\", \"score\": 3, \"detail\": \"No links to forum discussion or community feedback\"}]","flag_score":3,"first_seen":"2026-02-09T18:50:25.950966+00:00","last_updated":"2026-02-09T22:00:01.543836+00:00"},

The election, which filled three seats for a 146-epoch term (approximately two years) and four seats for a 73-epoch term (approximately one year), incorporated a novel selection method.\n\nFollowing the tallying of votes, the candidate with the highest number of votes was given the first choice of term length, either 146 or 73 epochs. Subsequently, the second-ranked candidate chose from the remaining options, and so on, until all term lengths were selected. This continued until only one option remained for the final candidates.\n\nThis governance action officially endorses the results of that electoral process, cementing the composition of the committee with its staggered terms designed to ensure operational continuity.\n\n**Note on Term Length Estimation:** The expiration epochs are estimates calculated for this governance action. The estimation accounts for the action's maximum 6-epoch lifetime, plus one epoch for enactment, in addition to the 73 or 146-epoch term length chosen by each member. Should this governance action be ratified sooner than its final epoch, the actual term for each member will be correspondingly longer.\n\n**For example:** As this governance action has a 6-epoch lifetime, if it is ratified in epoch 2, the committee members' terms would be 4 epochs longer than the minimum estimate.\n\nThe elected members are:\n\n| **Member** | **Cold Credential** | **Term Length Estimate** | **Expiration Epoch** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Cardano Atlantic Council | script-hash-349e55f83e9af24813e6cb368df6a80d38951b2a334dfcdf26815558 | 73 | 653 |\n| Tingvard | script-hash-1980dbf1ad624b0cb5410359b5ab14d008561994a6c2b6c53fabec00 | 146 | 726 |\n| Eastern Cardano Council | script-hash-84aebcfd3e00d0f87af918fc4b5e00135f407e379893df7e7d392c6a | 146 | 726 |\n| KtorZ | key-hash-dc0d6ef49590eb6880a50a00adde17596e6d76f7159572fa1ff85f2a | 73 | 653 |\n Ace Alliance | script-hash-9752e4306e5ae864441d21064f791174c8b626199b8e7a45f9e03b45 | 146 | 726 |\n| Cardano Japan Council | script-hash-9cc3f387623f45dae6a68b7096b0c2e403d8601a82dc40221ead41e2 | 73 | 653 |\n| Phil_uplc | key-hash-13493790d9b03483a1e1e684ea4faf1ee48a58f402574e7f2246f4d4 | 73 | 653 |\n\n**Note 1:** Term lengths were chosen by members based on their final tally position in the election. Cardano Atlantic Council, Tingvard, and the Eastern Cardano Council had first right of refusal to a two-year (146 epoch) term length.\n\n**Note 2:** Ratifying this governance action will remove the existing members of the interim Constitutional Committee: The Cardano Foundation, Input | Output Global, EMURGO, and Intersect. Cardano Atlantic Council, Eastern Cardano Council and Cardano Japan Council are members of the existing Interim Constitutional Committee, however have been selected to serve in the new committee. Cardano Atlantic Council and Eastern Cardano Council will continue to operate using the same cold credential. However, reflecting a change in its membership, Cardano Japan Council has generated a new credential for this new term.\n\n### Election Details\n\nIntersect’s Constitutional Committee election working group designed the election process to be:\n\n- **Adhering to the Cardano Constitution:** Ensuring all procedures were compliant with the foundational rules of the ecosystem.\n\n- **Accessible:** Allowing any Ada owner to register as a candidate.\n\n- **Transparent and Verifiable:** Building trust through an open process with verifiable, on-chain results.\n\nThe election process ran from May 5th to July 6th, 2025, and included distinct periods for candidate applications, DRep voting, and a final audit. The voting tools were provided by Byron Network, and the results of the DRep vote were independently verified by DQuadrant.","metadata_motivation":"The term for the current Interim Constitutional Committee is set to expire on September 6th (end of epoch 580). Therefore, this governance action is critical to formalize the results of the recent election and ensure a new Constitutional Committee (CC) is enacted in time.

The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledgebase.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.","metadata_motivation":"This proposal aims to solve the following problem:\n\nBloxBean has developed a suite of open-source Java tools essential for Cardano developers, including the Cardano Client Lib (CCL), Yaci, Yaci Store, and Yaci DevKit. These tools enable Java developers to interact seamlessly with the Cardano blockchain.\n\nTools like Yaci DevKit are also used by non-Java teams to quickly set up a local Cardano devnet for testing purposes.\n\nAs the Cardano ecosystem evolves, it is crucial to keep these tools up-to-date with the latest network changes, optimize their performance, and provide robust documentation and feature enhancements to ensure continued effectiveness.\n\nWhile BloxBean projects are supported by a small team of contributors, with the lead maintainer (Satya) being an employee of the Cardano Foundation, the growing demands for ongoing improvements require additional resources.\n\nThis proposal seeks funding to hire one additional full-time developer through BloxBean to support the maintenance and enhancement efforts for the next 12 months.\n\nBloxBean Tools Overview\n\n----------------------\n\n**Cardano Client Lib (CCL):** A powerful off-chain Java SDK designed for Java/Scala/Kotlin developers to build and submit all types of transactions to the Cardano Blockchain.

Unlike other blockchain ecosystems that provide clear financial backing for maintainers, contributors, and security efforts, Cardano's open-source projects often rely on ad-hoc funding or volunteer efforts.\n\nThis has led to several challenges:\n\n- Unmaintained Core Infrastructure: Key open-source repositories, including those used by dApp developers and the broader ecosystem, lack dedicated funding for long-term maintenance.\n\n- Loss of Contributors: Without clear incentives, experienced developers leave for other ecosystems, making it harder to sustain projects and onboard new talent.\n\n- Security Risks: A lack of structured funding for bug bounties and incident response leaves Cardano exposed to vulnerabilities that could otherwise be proactively addressed.\n\n- Slower Ecosystem Growth: The absence of stable funding for new tools, developer education, and strategic project support makes it difficult to keep pace with industry advancements.\n\n*Why This Matters*\n\nIf Cardano wants to remain a competitive, developer-friendly blockchain, it must invest in the sustainability of its open-source infrastructure. Without structured funding, key projects will stagnate, developer engagement will decline, and security risks will increase.\n\nA well-supported open-source ecosystem ensures:\n\n- Reliable infrastructure for wallets, dApps, and developer tooling.\n\n- More engaged developers who have clear pathways to contribute and earn.\n\n- Stronger security with funding for bug bounties and incident response.\n\n- A faster-growing ecosystem where teams can build with confidence, knowing key tools and services are actively maintained.","metadata_references":"[{\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Paid Open Source Model Whitepaper (PDF)\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafybeifv465wm3qzlarvosjlmlbokjdfvweny77ohcvip37gzofxwboqtu\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"The Paid Open-Source Model Concept (Youtube)\", \"uri\": \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4PgqaPWNT4&list=PLRiBopPuugERP0EzNVZNwK6fes4i5NRs4&index=3\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Open Source Committee Knowledge Base\", \"uri\": \"https://committees.docs.intersectmbo.org/intersect-open-source-committee\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Project Proposal In Ekklesia\", \"uri\": \"https://2025budget.intersectmbo.org/ballots/680d1b63565577986442d123/proposals/680d1b63565577986442d262\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Approved Budget Info Action submitted by Intersect via GovTool\", \"uri\": \"https://gov.tools/outcomes/governance_actions/e14de8d9dc4f4ddf3fe9250a8a926e20f10e99b86bd0610b77d7a054981591ee#0\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Details of all successful proposals (CSV)\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafybeicwrop4q7xvnyjdd5drumbe56sqtm5lbe2ul3c262zt4hgguzdycm\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Automating Accountability: Cardano's Smart Contract Framework Blog\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafybeihqx4ae72z7suqfnxrpqpqithp43cai7o2uuewnqtezgaoyc3ptyq\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Sundae Labs Budget Management Smart Contracts Github Repository\", \"uri\": \"https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Budget Management Smart Contracts TxPipe Audit Report\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafybeiccnwejbgj43wo6hrlseckkkmprtoqc5cfuy2hesm6c6yealwho3e\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Budget Management Smart Contracts MLabs Audit Report\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafybeiah5fnjhda5hemj3qvaehc4mre3qllqzw2l7mkdsguytn4ftgafw4\"}]","metadata_resolved":1,"metadata_hash_valid":1,"proposer_address":"","param_changes":null,"treasury_amount_lovelace":5885000000000,"treasury_recipients":"[{\"stake_address\": \"stake1uxzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6g7lgq9r\", \"amount\": \"5885000000000\"}]","flags":"[]","flag_score":0,"first_seen":"2026-02-09T18:50:25.950966+00:00","last_updated":"2026-02-09T22:00:01.543836+00:00"},

A bridge between Cardano and other blockchains would make it much easier for value to flow in from external ecosystems, increasing the liquidity available within Cardano.\n\nA zero-knowledge bridge, specifically, offers important advantages over alternative architectures such as optimistic bridges. In a ZK bridge, a single user action accompanied by a succinct proof of deposit is sufficient to release tokens on the destination blockchain. This eliminates the need for community-wide monitoring or challenge periods, significantly reducing latency and trust assumptions.\n\nAdditionally, by building a ZK bridge, Cardano positions itself as a more interoperable platform, capable of engaging with the broader ecosystem of zero-knowledge technologies. This lays the groundwork for future innovations in identity, privacy-preserving applications, and cross-chain collaboration.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nEryx is a worker-owned labor cooperative with almost 15 years of experience solving complex problems involving mathematics and software. We are a group of nerdy PhDs with a solid background in math and computer science. Our team has extensive experience in blockchain development, cryptography, and privacy-focused protocols, which gives us the expertise required to successfully deliver the project.\n\nAmong other things, we've been core contributors to the Lambdaworks library and implemented the CircleSTARKS protocol in GPU alongside with Nethermind. This involved implementing several ZK cryptographic primitives (field operations, polynomial commitment schemes, FRI protocols, FFTs), in different platforms and languages. Furthermore, we implemented a proving system based on the Plonk protocol. During this project we wrote a simple interface to design circuits. It included basic operations and conditionals that made the building blocks for more complex cryptographic primitives. We also developed a Plonky2 backend for Aztec's Noir, funded by the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nIn relation to this proposal, we have extensive experience in Aiken smart contract development, including previously funded proposals under Project Catalyst focused on educational and technical infrastructure for Cardano. We also wrote zk circuits for cryptographic primitives such as hash functions and elliptic curve operations.\n\nWe are active contributors to the ENCOINS protocol, currently deployed on the Cardano mainnet with privacy-preserving features. Currently, we are researching the integration of ZK systems with the EUTxO model.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect.

While the ecosystem is advancing in scalability through projects like Hydra and optimistic roll ups such as Midgard it still lacks a secure, trustless, and modular zk-based bridge infrastructure.\n\nCurrent bridges rely on centralized validators or multi-signature schemes, introducing major security risks---as demonstrated by numerous high-profile exploits in other ecosystems. Without a native zero-knowledge bridge, Cardano is unable to safely connect with external chains, severely limiting access to external liquidity, composability with other ecosystems, and the ability to scale horizontally.\n\nFurthermore, the Cardano ecosystem lacks a unified open-source toolkit for:\n\nOn-chain verification of zero-knowledge proofs\n\nSecure and efficient cross-chain messaging\n\nAsset wrapping and unwrapping under Cardano's native token model\n\nAnd trust-minimized interoperability with existing ZK-rollups.\n\nThis absence puts Cardano at a competitive disadvantage compared to platforms like Ethereum, which already benefit from multiple zk-based Layer 2 solutions and zk-enabled bridges.\n\nA modular zkBridge is not only critical to unlock interoperability---it also lays the groundwork for a future Cardano-native zkRollup framework, by enabling the testing and deployment of foundational components such as provers, verifiers, and state synchronization mechanisms.","metadata_references":"[{\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"ZkBridge Cardano Proposal (PDF)\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafybeic6onenqv7xguen3klpqlwly5dvxlfanaws4z4knfwg7w5vksp72q\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Eryx Coop ACVM Backend Plonky2 GitHub Repository\", \"uri\": \"https://github.com/eryxcoop/acvm-backend-plonky2\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Eryx Coop one-pager (PDF)\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafybeidoz5frkc4fd2lrn7gmoxvgl3ltognd7lm6kltnnj62qdw57r7u4i\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"ZKCity Educational Bootcamp where we were main lecturers\", \"uri\": \"https://www.zkcity.xyz\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Eryx Coop ZK Adventures GitHub Repository\", \"uri\": \"https://github.com/eryxcoop/zk-adventures\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Contributions to open source Zk projects 1\", \"uri\": \"https://github.com/starkware-libs/stwo/commits/dev/?author=carlogf\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Contributions to open source Zk projects 2\", \"uri\": \"https://github.com/starkware-libs/stwo/commits/dev/?author=jarnesino\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Contributions to open source Zk projects 3\", \"uri\": \"https://github.com/starkware-libs/stwo-cairo/commits/main/?author=ajgara\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Contributions to open source Zk projects 4\", \"uri\": \"https://github.com/starkware-libs/stwo-cairo/commits/main/?author=atgrosso\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Contributions to open source Zk projects 5\", \"uri\": \"https://github.com/starkware-libs/stwo-cairo/commits/main/?author=schouhy\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Contributions to open source Zk projects 6\", \"uri\": \"https://github.com/0xPolygonZero/plonky2/pull/1645\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Circle STARK GPU Acceleration Talk by our partner Julian\", \"uri\": \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EOjrYnrE8g\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Project Proposal In Ekklesia\", \"uri\": \"https://2025budget.intersectmbo.org/ballots/680d1b63565577986442d123/proposals/680d1b63565577986442d172\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Approved Budget Info Action submitted by Intersect via GovTool\", \"uri\": \"https://gov.tools/outcomes/governance_actions/e14de8d9dc4f4ddf3fe9250a8a926e20f10e99b86bd0610b77d7a054981591ee#0\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Details of all successful proposals (CSV)\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafybeicwrop4q7xvnyjdd5drumbe56sqtm5lbe2ul3c262zt4hgguzdycm\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Automating Accountability: Cardano's Smart Contract Framework Blog\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafybeihqx4ae72z7suqfnxrpqpqithp43cai7o2uuewnqtezgaoyc3ptyq\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Sundae Labs Budget Management Smart Contracts Github Repository\", \"uri\": \"https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Budget Management Smart Contracts TxPipe Audit Report\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafybeiccnwejbgj43wo6hrlseckkkmprtoqc5cfuy2hesm6c6yealwho3e\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Budget Management Smart Contracts MLabs Audit Report\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafybeiah5fnjhda5hemj3qvaehc4mre3qllqzw2l7mkdsguytn4ftgafw4\"}]","metadata_resolved":1,"metadata_hash_valid":1,"proposer_address":"","param_changes":null,"treasury_amount_lovelace":700000000000,"treasury_recipients":"[{\"stake_address\": \"stake1uxzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6g7lgq9r\", \"amount\": \"700000000000\"}]","flags":"[]","flag_score":0,"first_seen":"2026-02-09T18:50:25.950966+00:00","last_updated":"2026-02-09T22:00:01.543836+00:00"},

All transaction fees on Midgard are paid in Ada, and every Midgard block is published to the Cardano L1. Where Hydra moves transactions offchain (and thus does not contribute consistently in fee revenue to the Cardano L1) Midgard keeps transactions on-chain but in a more compact form (ie. rolls up transactions offchain into a compact representation that is published on-chain, thus the name rollups). This means that increased economic activity on Midgard directly translated to increased economic activity on Cardano, this represents a significant source of fee revenue for the Cardano L1. Midgard does not have independent consensus or economic security, instead it inherits economic security and consensus from Cardano.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nAnastasia Labs is at the forefront of research & development on Cardano for over two years now. We have been involved in the development of nearly every large dApp on Cardano. We have made contributions to many of the core repos, and we actively maintain over 50 different open-source libraries, tools, and public infrastructure for Cardano.\n\nYou can read more about our work here:\n\n[https://www.anastasialabs.com/](https://www.anastasialabs.com/)\n\nFurthermore, Midgard is already in active development, and we have already made significant progress towards our goal of EOY mainnet readiness.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs.

Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR.

It allows us to build true L2 rollups that inherit maximal security from Cardano. This cannot be replicated in account based systems. It's not a coincidence that Fuel, the first general purpose L2 to receive a decentralization rating of stage 2 (highest possible) is UTxO based.\n\nFraud proofs for global state systems like Arbitrum and Optimism are extremely difficult to implement and very expensive and complicated to conduct onchain (and require multiple parties); this is why to this date despite spending millions in R&D neither of those protocols has working fraud proofs, and they all rely on centralized permissioned sequencers and operators.\n\nOn the other-hand, fraud proofs on Cardano are extremely straightforward and require only a single party (no challenge-response proofs) due to the local state properties of the ledger.\n\nNot a single blockchain has managed to achieve true permissionless general purpose rollups. At the end of the day, the top \"L2s\"in the blockchain space right now are all custodial multisigs. The Midgard framework is a first of its kind, in its capabilities to deploy completely permissionless rollups that inherit the full security of Cardano.\n\n- No centralized sequencer\n\n- No challenge response \"proofs\"\n\n- No custodial multisig\n\n- Permissionless fraud proofs (open to anyone)\n\n- Permissionless operator set\n\n- Deposits and withdrawals cannot be censored (inherits the full censorship resistance of Cardano)\n\nThis is all made possible by Cardano's unique local state EUTxO architecture.\n\nUTxO contention, small block size, local state, transaction determinism, all of these \"problems\" may have led you to question why these design choices were made.\n\nMidgard aims to show you that these are actually not problems at all. In-fact quite the opposite, they are extremely powerful properties that, together, provide unique value that simply does not exist in any other ecosystem. These are, in actuality, the core pillars that make Midgard even possible in the first place.\n\nYou cannot build Midgard on Ethereum, Solana or Sui.

Enhances overall network security, resilience, and decentralization. Fosters supplier diversity through knowledge sharing and modular architecture (Acropolis). The ROI stems from increased network capacity, utility, and attractiveness, driving adoption and value.\n\n* **For End Users:** Experience significantly reduced network congestion and faster transaction processing (Leios), near-instant finality for specific applications (Hydra), the convenience of paying fees with native tokens (Nested Transactions/Babel Fees), and potentially more predictable transaction inclusion (Tiered Pricing). Enhanced security measures build user trust.\n\n* **For Developers & dApp Builders:** Gain access to advanced tools for building more secure and efficient smart contracts (Plutus High Assurance suite, Plutus Core enhancements). Benefit from a more extensible and accessible node architecture (Acropolis), easier integration with L2s and light clients (Hydra, Mithril), and improved transaction capabilities (Nested Transactions). This lowers development barriers and enables more sophisticated applications.\n\n* **For Stake Pool Operators (SPOs):** Benefit from significantly reduced node operational costs (lower RAM requirements via Ledger-HD, LSM/UTXO-HD), enhanced operational security (KES Agent), improved network performance, potential new revenue streams (Minotaur AVS), and a potentially fairer incentive structure (Revised Scheme investigation). Mithril improvements speed up node synchronization.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nInput Output (IO) realized Cardano's vision for a secure, scalable, decentralized platform through a research-driven, phased delivery (Byron to Voltaire). Leveraging formal methods, functional programming, and rigorous engineering, IO produced key achievements including Proof-of-Stake, Ouroboros consensus, Plutus smart contracts, native tokens, and scaling solutions like Hydra and Mithril.\n\nIOE and its partners' involvement spans the entire existence of Cardano, and is demonstrated daily by its active development, support, and maintenance. Key personnel essential to this long-standing contribution are retained to continue this effort through 2025 and into 2026.\n\nIO remains committed to furthering Cardano's technical development, research and community engagement.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect.

Direct API access to `/metadata`, `/image`, `/file` native assets using only their fingerprint ID. Cloudflare offers no blockchain/NFT support; this would have to be custom built by devs.\n\n- **Multi-protocol/system support**: NFTCDN auto-handles multimedia storage fetching from IPFS, Arweave, HTTP, on-chain. Cloudflare requires devs to build fetch/parsing logic manually on their own infra setup.\n\n- **Standards-aware infra**: NFTCDN supports CIP-25, 68, v0.01 and adapts as they evolve. Cloudflare has no protocol awareness - devs must implement parsing module compliance manually and cater for human error and edge cases.\n\n- **No infra required**: NFTCDN handles full resolution flow (parsing, error fall-back, and format support) out of the box. Cloudflare needs origin setup and content pre-hosted on their proprietary solutions.\n\n- **Real-time chain indexing**: Native assets state updated live (minting & updating) from chain. Cloudflare requires manual indexing, pointer mgmt, and cache invalidation.\n\n- **Cloudflare TOS risk**: Large or non-web file caching (image, audio, video, 3D files) is restricted; in-production use will violate TOS unless using proprietary paid products (Stream/Images/R2, c. ~$5k+/yr).\n\n- **Global cross-app caching**: NFTCDN caches assets at the asset level, so cache `HITS` benefit all products (websites & dApps). Cloudflare caches per domain/site - no sharing resulting in low CDN performance resulting in higher cache `MISS` states.\n\n- **Built-in content safety**: NFTCDN provides CSP headers + dev. controls over rendering. Cloudflare lacks native asset-specific safeguards, increasing risk of suspension due to embedded malicious multimedia content.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledgebase.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.","metadata_motivation":"This proposal aims to solve the following problem:\n\n### Background - Native Assets\n\n- Native assets (NFTs & FTs) are widely used on Cardano across diverse use cases\n\n- Often used to store multimedia content - images, music, videos, documents, etc\n\n- Media is stored on decentralised systems - IPFS, Arweave, and on-chain embeds\n\n- Centralised storage options also used - HTTP, FTP & commercial cloud providers\n\n- File locations are referenced as links within the native asset's metadata\n\n### Pain Point - Technical Complexity\n\n- Accessing native asset media requires querying the blockchain (Cardano node + DB-Sync)\n\n- And fetching content via middleware (e.g. IPFS gateway/node)\n\n- Apps must handle this process programmatically, at scale, with robust exception handling\n\n- Developers face challenges from:\n\n- Human error (e.g. typos in metadata links)\n\n- Evolving standards (e.g. NFT v0.01, CIP-25, CIP-68)\n\n- Protocol updates (e.g. Chang HF impacting Node & DB-Sync)\n\n- Performance, efficiency, and reliability must be maintained across all layers\n\n- Apps must build and maintain complex, resilient backend infrastructure to support native asset display as both a capability & feature\n\n### Solution -- NFTCDN\n\n- NFTCDN is a managed Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) provider\n\n- Provides high-availability native asset media & metadata delivery via globally distributed, high-speed Content Delivery Network\n\n- Developers access content using only the native asset fingerprint ID - no complex setup needed\n\n- Eliminates the need to design, build, test, & maintain complex end-to-end infra\n\n- Enables focus on innovation of their product - not backend ops\n\n### Problem Statement - Cost to Build/Access\n\n- Building native asset delivery infra in-house costs ~$100,000 and 9+ months (internal benchmarks)\n\n- NFTCDN solves upfront CAPEX/OPEX needs\n\n- But we are a paid service (pay-per-API-call) - limiting adoption\n\n- Only well-funded teams have been able to integrate NFTCDN to date\n\n- Many projects cannot afford the cost, leading to delays, increased risk, or total shutdown\n\n- Market headwinds further impacted adoption, with some customers forced to shut down due to reduced user base","metadata_references":"[{\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"NFTCDN Website\", \"uri\": \"https://nftcdn.io/\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"NFTCDN Support Documentation Github Repository\", \"uri\": \"https://github.com/nftcdn/support.nftcdn.io\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"NFTCDN Discord\", \"uri\": \"https://discord.nftcdn.io/\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Project Proposal In Ekklesia\", \"uri\": \"https://2025budget.intersectmbo.org/ballots/680d1b63565577986442d123/proposals/680d1b63565577986442d1d8\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Approved Budget Info Action submitted by Intersect via GovTool\", \"uri\": \"https://gov.tools/outcomes/governance_actions/e14de8d9dc4f4ddf3fe9250a8a926e20f10e99b86bd0610b77d7a054981591ee#0\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Details of all successful proposals (CSV)\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafybeicwrop4q7xvnyjdd5drumbe56sqtm5lbe2ul3c262zt4hgguzdycm\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Automating Accountability: Cardano's Smart Contract Framework Blog\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafybeihqx4ae72z7suqfnxrpqpqithp43cai7o2uuewnqtezgaoyc3ptyq\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Sundae Labs Budget Management Smart Contracts Github Repository\", \"uri\": \"https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Budget Management Smart Contracts TxPipe Audit Report\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafybeiccnwejbgj43wo6hrlseckkkmprtoqc5cfuy2hesm6c6yealwho3e\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Budget Management Smart Contracts MLabs Audit Report\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafybeiah5fnjhda5hemj3qvaehc4mre3qllqzw2l7mkdsguytn4ftgafw4\"}]","metadata_resolved":1,"metadata_hash_valid":1,"proposer_address":"","param_changes":null,"treasury_amount_lovelace":605000000000,"treasury_recipients":"[{\"stake_address\": \"stake1uxzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6g7lgq9r\", \"amount\": \"605000000000\"}]","flags":"[]","flag_score":0,"first_seen":"2026-02-09T18:50:25.950966+00:00","last_updated":"2026-02-09T22:00:01.543836+00:00"},

Catalyst-funded initiatives often operate under independent branding which rarely mentions 'Cardano' which dilutes the visibility of Cardano within the broader blockchain community. This fragmented approach makes it harder for Cardano to stand out amidst the competition.\n\nCompetitors like Solana, Aptos, and Sui have established significant brand recognition by strategically aligning global events with developer-focused initiatives.\n\nTheir series of hacker houses and hubs---typically held 3--4 times per year---have successfully fostered active developer communities and increased Total Value Locked (TVL) on their platforms. These events seamlessly blend ecosystems, attracting talent and partnerships across multiple chains while solidifying their reputation as innovative blockchain leaders.\n\nWithout a similarly coordinated and impactful event strategy, Cardano risks being overshadowed in a competitive landscape. A fresh approach to event planning is essential to position Cardano alongside top players and attract developers, partners, and enthusiasts from across the blockchain ecosystem.","metadata_references":"[{\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Unified Global Events Marketing Strategy for Cardano (PDF)\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafybeiem32fufh2xuznlsdsxc7nybutbv4352iqu22mzt5amdvxjsh6cbm\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"List of Proposed Events & Budget (PDF)\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafkreihbmieixckirag2bb7sfqhfjpmbp4ygdujokiyphx4yus644k4nte\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Project Proposal In Ekklesia\", \"uri\": \"https://2025budget.intersectmbo.org/ballots/680d1b63565577986442d123/proposals/680d1b63565577986442d222\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Approved Budget Info Action submitted by Intersect via GovTool\", \"uri\": \"https://gov.tools/outcomes/governance_actions/e14de8d9dc4f4ddf3fe9250a8a926e20f10e99b86bd0610b77d7a054981591ee#0\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Details of all successful proposals (CSV)\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafybeicwrop4q7xvnyjdd5drumbe56sqtm5lbe2ul3c262zt4hgguzdycm\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Automating Accountability: Cardano's Smart Contract Framework Blog\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafybeihqx4ae72z7suqfnxrpqpqithp43cai7o2uuewnqtezgaoyc3ptyq\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Sundae Labs Budget Management Smart Contracts Github Repository\", \"uri\": \"https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Budget Management Smart Contracts TxPipe Audit Report\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafybeiccnwejbgj43wo6hrlseckkkmprtoqc5cfuy2hesm6c6yealwho3e\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Budget Management Smart Contracts MLabs Audit Report\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafybeiah5fnjhda5hemj3qvaehc4mre3qllqzw2l7mkdsguytn4ftgafw4\"}]","metadata_resolved":1,"metadata_hash_valid":1,"proposer_address":"","param_changes":null,"treasury_amount_lovelace":6000000000000,"treasury_recipients":"[{\"stake_address\": \"stake1uxzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6g7lgq9r\", \"amount\": \"6000000000000\"}]","flags":"[]","flag_score":0,"first_seen":"2026-02-09T18:50:25.950966+00:00","last_updated":"2026-02-09T22:00:01.543836+00:00"},

CB DAO fills that gap.**\n\nThrough a **transparent governance framework**, **strict accountability mechanisms**, and a **metrics-first funding approach**, CB DAO ensures that builders with growing products on mainnet can scale sustainably, integrate cutting-edge Cardano infrastructure (e.g. Hydra, Leios, Midgard), and contribute to the ecosystem's long-term growth.\n\nThis Treasury Withdrawal is submitted by Intersect on behalf of the vendor.

This enables Project Catalyst to be a more effective innovation engine as larger projects will not rely on Project Catalyst for funding.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nOur team is responsible for building and maintaining Clarity, a governance platform purpose-built for the Cardano ecosystem. Clarity serves as the user-facing interface for interacting with Agora, an open-source, audited library of smart contracts designed for decentralized governance and treasury management.\n\nWe have already deployed this infrastructure in production and actively maintain it. Our smart contracts have governed over $10 million in Total Value Locked (TVL) and are used by four DAOs, each managing six-figure treasuries on-chain. These DAOs use the same tooling and processes that CB DAO will leverage, including member-based voting, proposal submission, temperature checks, and treasury execution fully enforced by smart contracts.\n\nIn addition to our technical capabilities, we work directly with Cardano ecosystem founders and project teams on a regular basis. Many of these projects are already live on mainnet, and several have expressed intent to participate in CB DAO as members during the initial cohort. This gives us a direct line of communication with the builder community and allows us to ensure early DAO membership includes high-quality, committed teams aligned with CB DAO's mission and KPIs.\n\nOur team's combination of hands-on DAO implementation, infrastructure development, and builder community engagement positions us uniquely to lead the operational launch and ongoing management of the Cardano Builder DAO.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs.

The information provided herein is intended to fulfill the spirit of the constitutional requirement for a treasury withdrawal info action by also providing the details of the proposed solution, alignment to the budget, and amount to be withdrawn from the Cardano Treasury.","metadata_rationale":"### Project Solution\n\nThe Extended Quadratic Funding model doesn't replace Project Catalyst but complements it, bringing additional funding, greater participation, and enhanced accountability to Cardano's innovation ecosystem.\n\nWe propose a complementary funding mechanism that addresses these challenges through a combination of innovative approaches:\n\n### 1. Democratizing Decision-Making\n\nOur extended quadratic funding model calculates voting power using two factors:\n\n1. **Square root of donation amount** (e.g., $9 donation = 3 votes)\n\n2. **Logarithmic reputation score** (Impact Score) ranging from 300-850\n\nThis approach balances financial contribution with proven community impact, preventing wealth concentration from dominating decisions while maintaining skin-in-the-game principles.\n\nTo protect this system's integrity, we implement:\n\n- **Sybil resistance:** Zero-knowledge proof KYC via Hyperledger Identus (formerly Atala PRISM) ensures one-human-one-account without compromising privacy\n\n- **Anti-collusion measures:**\n\n- Reputation incentives that make system integrity valuable to high-impact participants\n\n- Penalties including reputation loss or platform bans for collusion attempts\n\n- Economic disincentives through fee structures that make vote-splitting unprofitable\n\n- Use [Connection-Oriented Cluster Matching](https://www.gitcoin.co/blog/leveling-the-field-how-connection-oriented-cluster-matching-strengthens-quadratic-funding)\n\nFor more information on formal proofs of quadratic voting and literature reviews, see [Kovalchuk et al. 2024](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hq_P_BEvXDhJcph6zmA0_CQHTcO0lyAZ/view?usp=sharing), [Ostrom 2010](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ej30QuyfcyCjNABd6O6S3MEk5Dy14WyL/view?usp=sharing), [Lalley and Weyl 2015](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EjZoN4Gcxjwb0Va0OuRgEgBYRVcgDiWI/view?usp=drive_link) and [Poster and Weyl 2019](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1E_tXBhMIO6WLeVVpv3J_AsicTiSKAUze/view?usp=drive_link)\n\n### 2. Multiplying Treasury Impact\n\nOur model transforms the treasury from sole funder to catalyst:\n\n- Individual donors contribute alongside treasury funds, potentially increasing available capital by 50%+\n\n- U.S. donors benefit from 501(c)(3) tax deductions, creating unique incentives outside the crypto ecosystem\n\n- Donations increase projects' chances of receiving matching funds, aligning individual and ecosystem interests\n\n**Example:** A $1M treasury allocation could attract $500K in individual donations, yielding $1.5M total funding while building broader community investment. Please see more details in the \"Why this amount\" section below.\n\n### 3. Standardized Impact Reporting\n\nAll funded projects must:\n\n- Contract with designated impact accountants (funded from project allocation)\n\n- Report standardized metrics including:\n\n- On-chain transactions generated\n\n- New wallets created\n\n- Active users acquired\n\n- Other ecosystem growth indicators\n\nThis creates the first comprehensive dataset of innovation ROI within the Cardano ecosystem.\n\n### 4. Sustainable Value Capture\n\nWe establish a voluntary contribution system where funded projects share value with the ecosystem through:\n\n- Equity stakes\n\n- Token allocations\n\n- Revenue sharing agreements\n\n- Carbon credits or other generated assets\n\nOur target is a 5% annual return within 10 years---an ambitious but achievable goal based on startup ecosystem standards.\n\nThe most reliable measure of VC fund returns comes from the Cambridge Associates US Venture Capital Index, which shows an 8.5% annual return over 10 years as of December 31, 2023. While this net return to limited partners reflects the overall pooled performance, typical median returns are lower, around 4-5%, due to the skewed distribution of returns.\n\nSources:\n\n- [Cambridge Associates US PE/VC Benchmark Commentary Calendar Year 2023](https://www.cambridgeassociates.com/insight/us-pe-vc-benchmark-commentary-calendar-year-2023/)\n\n- [Seraf-Investor.com Dividing the Pie: How Venture Fund Economics Work Part II](http://seraf-investor.com)\n\n- [Emmanuel Maggiori Venture Capital Returns: True Lies?](https://emaggiori.com/venture-capital-returns/)\n\n- [Founder Equity Fund The New Reality of Venture Capital](https://founderequity.com/the-new-reality-of-venture-capital)\n\n- [British Business Bank UK Venture Capital Financial Returns 2024](https://www.british-business-bank.co.uk/about/research-and-publications/uk-venture-capital-financial-returns-2024)\n\n- [EY Q2 2023 Venture Capital Investment Trends](https://www.ey.com/en_us/insights/growth/q2-2023-venture-capital-investment-trends)\n\n- [Jumpstart Magazine How Long Until a VC Makes Returns?](https://www.jumpstartmag.com/how-long-until-a-vc-makes-returns/)\n\n- [Cambridge Associates WEB-2020-Q2-USVC-Benchmark-Book](https://www.cambridgeassociates.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/WEB-2020-Q2-USVC-Benchmark-Book.pdf)\n\n### 5. Efficient Milestone Management\n\nOur streamlined process features:\n\n- Token incentives for prompt reviewer decisions\n\n- Financial penalties for reviewers whose decisions are overturned\n\n- Decentralized dispute resolution mechanism (detailed at: [https://socious.gitbook.io/whitepaper/decentralized-dispute-resolution](https://socious.gitbook.io/whitepaper/decentralized-dispute-resolution))\n\nThis creates a self-balancing system encouraging both speed and accuracy.\n\nThis is particularly beneficial for teams seeking small amounts of funding, who often struggle with Catalyst's lengthy milestone approval process.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nOur team is uniquely qualified to deliver this project successfully.

Our talent marketplace, Socious, is a hub for over 12,000 individuals, many of whom could potentially assist in this project, if required.\n\nThe trustworthiness in our fund management processes is grounded in our serious adherence to legal and financial compliance. Each transaction conducted is meticulously documented with tangible evidence and audited internally for accuracy. To bolster our commitment to financial transparency, we have established collaborations with external accounting firms that assure compliance. We work with ([Tatsumi Accounting Firm](https://kessan-online.jp/company)) and ([BBCIncorp](https://bbcincorp.com/offshore/accounting-and-auditing)).\n\nAdditionally, we liaise with an external law firm,([Enlighten Law Group](https://www.enlightenlaw.com/)), to ensure full legal compliance. This meticulous, multilayered approach to fund management reflects our dedication to maintaining high levels of trust and accountability.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledgebase.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account.

We will identify and benchmark key governance metrics to assess the health, performance, and overall impact of our decentralized decision-making processes. The resulting 'State of Governance' report will provide a structured evaluation of participation, track vital Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), map the evolving governance ecosystem, and pinpoint specific areas for improvement.\n\nTo ensure our findings are grounded in real-world experience, we will engage the Cardano community through various channels. These include virtual workshops, targeted surveys, and in-depth user interviews. By actively gathering and synthesizing community insights, we will gain a comprehensive understanding of the current state of governance. This will allow us to formulate actionable recommendations and pave the way for post-MVG (Minimum Viable Governance) evolution.

We will forge that future by moving beyond Minimum Viable Governance (MVG) to craft a dynamic, adaptable system with a clear, cost-effective process to pinpoint the real challenges faced by those who participate in governance. By putting this process into action, we will deliver transparent, insightful findings and expert analysis. Where needed, these insights will be translated into concrete proposals (CIPs or CPSs) reflecting community consensus. This initiative will kickstart ongoing governance optimization, empowering the community to actively monitor and address critical risks, ensuring Cardano remains a leader in decentralized decision-making.\n\n* The process outputs will be published including a state of governance report with measurement methods and workshop data with analysis\n\n* A playbook will be published with details about how to repeat the process and include lessons learned\n\n* Any CPS and CIPs will be authored by this team as a milestone of this funding, but the team will be open for other interested co-authors and collaborators\n\n* Further funding would be required to move a CPS to a CIP, or to implement a CIP\n\n* This could become a repeated process if the community finds value in funding these activities annually\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nThis project will be driven by a robust coalition of experienced stakeholders dedicated to the advancement of Cardano's governance. Input Output's Voltaire team will provide core leadership, leveraging their unique role as the architects of Cardano's governance framework.

Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR.

All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC.

This will be achieved by providing clear paths for the broader Cardano community to participate in the 2030 vision creation process---both by contributing insights as key stakeholders and by enabling the collection of additional input through structured user and customer interviews, along with targeted product research initiatives.\n\nKey Outcomes and value this proposal will deliver:\n\n- Broad community participation in the first community-driven Cardano vision creation process\n\n- Documented insights from the community shared brain\n\n- Documented insights from key groups (such as SPOs, builders, and businesses in and outside of Cardano and Blockchain)\n\n- Participation in creating and critiquing the first draft proposal for a 2030 Cardano vision\n\n- Creation of the first framework and consolidated data set of insights coming from product research guiding Cardano (and builders on Cardano) on what are the most prominent user needs and the key market opportunities\n\n- Opportunities to access funding to run product research initiatives\n\n- Identify promising focus areas for Cardano to achieve product-market-fit, which can be coordinated with the Technical Steering Committee of Intersect to ultimately identify mission-critical Cardano feature sets\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nIntersect is a non-profit member-based organization incorporated in Wyoming, USA. The team at Intersect represents a broad mix of experience and domain expertise, spanning open source, governance, infrastructure, fintech, and decentralized systems. Many of our team members are long-standing contributors to Cardano and are deeply embedded in the ecosystem - both professionally and as community participants.\n\nThe Cardano Product Committee of Intersect is made of members' elected product experts with knowledge in business, market research, and user research. The committee is also supported by academic researchers and it will consult Subject Matter Experts to define research initiatives and allocate funds in an open and transparent process to expert providers, as well as to properly document and share all the collected insights.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the Constitution. Intersect will administer the contract on behalf of its members and in alignment with governance actions approved by DReps. This includes coordinating project delivery schedules, reporting progress transparently to our members and the community, and escalating any disputes to the Governing Board and membership for resolution in accordance with established procedures.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the Constitution.

Now it's time to define an open, shared, and transparent process for the Cardano community to define a long-term vision and a roadmap.\n\nCreating a long-term vision in a small group is not easy, and it gets more complex as more stakeholders participate. One of Cardano's strengths is its community-shared mind, so the challenge is to define a reusable process to leverage Cardano's shared mind to create a long-term vision for Cardano and make it operational.\n\nFurthermore, as Cardano advances toward a maturing ecosystem, its future hinges on informed decision-making. However, the ecosystem currently lacks a dedicated, rigorous, and consolidated product research function to guide these decisions across themes such as user adoption, developer onboarding, governance participation, competitive positioning, and broader awareness. This absence limits our ability to reliably measure barriers, understand emerging needs, and identify product-market fit opportunities.\n\nCardano overall, and builders across the ecosystem, operate without a shared, research-backed understanding of what users actually need or how to prioritize strategic direction. Existing insights are scattered or outdated, and there is no ecosystem-wide standard for how assumptions are challenged or validated. This creates the risk of fragmentation as well as solutions that don't address real user pain points or market gaps.","metadata_references":"[{\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"2025 Research Budget - Product Research Proposal\", \"uri\": \"https://productcommittee.docs.intersectmbo.org/committee-outcomes/2025-proposed-research-budget#product-research-sub-bucket\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"2025 Research Budget - Vision Creation\", \"uri\": \"https://productcommittee.docs.intersectmbo.org/committee-outcomes/2025-proposed-research-budget#vision-creation-sub-bucket\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Cardano Forum submission and comments\", \"uri\": \"https://forum.cardano.org/t/cardano-research-budget-proposal/\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"2025 Broad Goals\", \"uri\": \"https://productcommittee.docs.intersectmbo.org/committee-outcomes/2025-cardanos-roadmap/2025-proposed-cardano-goals\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"2025 Product Roadmap\", \"uri\": \"https://productcommittee.docs.intersectmbo.org/committee-outcomes/2025-cardanos-roadmap/2025-proposed-cardano-roadmap\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"2025 Product Roadmap info action via GovTool\", \"uri\": \"https://gov.tools/outcomes/governance_actions/56f39054758f1a3cedc1de9225d66bf270b62dfdbfbc5399f1d6d43aceffc636#0\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"2030 Long-Term Cardano Vision process\", \"uri\": \"https://productcommittee.docs.intersectmbo.org/committee-outcomes/2030-long-term-cardano-vision\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Cardano Product Committee details\", \"uri\": \"https://productcommittee.docs.intersectmbo.org/\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Project Proposal In Ekklesia\", \"uri\": \"https://2025budget.intersectmbo.org/ballots/680d1b63565577986442d123/proposals/680d1b63565577986442d204\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Approved Budget Info Action submitted by Intersect via GovTool\", \"uri\": \"https://gov.tools/outcomes/governance_actions/e14de8d9dc4f4ddf3fe9250a8a926e20f10e99b86bd0610b77d7a054981591ee#0\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Details of all successful proposals (CSV)\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafybeicwrop4q7xvnyjdd5drumbe56sqtm5lbe2ul3c262zt4hgguzdycm\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Automating Accountability: Cardano's Smart Contract Framework Blog\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafybeihqx4ae72z7suqfnxrpqpqithp43cai7o2uuewnqtezgaoyc3ptyq\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Sundae Labs Budget Management Smart Contracts Github Repository\", \"uri\": \"https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Budget Management Smart Contracts TxPipe Audit Report\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafybeiccnwejbgj43wo6hrlseckkkmprtoqc5cfuy2hesm6c6yealwho3e\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Budget Management Smart Contracts MLabs Audit Report\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafybeiah5fnjhda5hemj3qvaehc4mre3qllqzw2l7mkdsguytn4ftgafw4\"}]","metadata_resolved":1,"metadata_hash_valid":1,"proposer_address":"","param_changes":null,"treasury_amount_lovelace":750000000000,"treasury_recipients":"[{\"stake_address\": \"stake1uxzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6g7lgq9r\", \"amount\": \"750000000000\"}]","flags":"[]","flag_score":0,"first_seen":"2026-02-09T18:50:25.950966+00:00","last_updated":"2026-02-09T22:00:01.543836+00:00"},

Through these three interlinked workstreams: Catalyst Interface Development, Hermes Decentralized Infrastructure, and the execution of three Funding Rounds the return on investment for this proposal is measured in tangible, ecosystem-wide outcomes, including:\n\n1. **For the Ecosystem:** Significant reduction in operational costs, with potential savings of up to 50% in future Catalyst cycles from 2026 onward and broader and more meaningful community participation by strengthening Cardano's decentralized innovation funding infrastructure with expanded governance functionality and funding flexibility, with support for multiple voting mechanics and the ability to participate using Cardano Native Tokens beyond ADA.\n\n2. **For Cardano Developers, Entrepreneurs, and Community Builders:** Continued assurance of community-led funding, giving hundreds of community builders the confidence to plan and scale their projects, supported by a trusted, experienced, and committed Catalyst operations team. ₳61 million to be deployed across three funding rounds, including the launch of a Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RetroPGF) initiative, designed to reward high-impact contributions that have already been delivered - even if not initially funded through a Catalyst vote. The results are increased support for early stage R&D, open-source, regional, and community-led initiatives, guided by more equitable and representative voting mechanisms.\n\n3. **For End Users :** Seamless, scalable, and accessible Catalyst infrastructure delivered through unified, device-agnostic interfaces lowering barriers to participation, particularly in mobile-first regions, enabled by enhanced user interfaces and experience and production-grade decentralized infrastructure powered by Hermes, replacing legacy federated systems with peer-to-peer architecture. The sum of these parts aligns directly with Cardano's broader goals of decentralization, transparency, and system resilience. Plus the introduction of optionality between delegated and direct voting that improves governance legitimacy, with greater transparency, auditability, and resilience across funding and decision-making processes due to investment in interfaces and infrastructure.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nThe Catalyst Team brings over four years of experience delivering the Catalyst program. Since 2021, the Catalyst Team has processed over 3 million governance decisions, allocated ₳290 million to 2091 projects from 114 countries in 6 continents, and operated 13 successful funding rounds with a well-established governance, compliance, technology, transparency and accountability framework. Catalyst's Fund Operations team has facilitated more than 12,000 individual payments to grantees, totaling ₳180,274,235 in addition to tens of thousands more payments for incentivised community roles demonstrating its commitment to operational and financial compliance integrity. The Catalyst technical team has pioneered decentralized voting solutions, including privacy-preserving voting, quadratic voting, and the development of a prototype Hermes engine in Cardano. The team remains committed to engaging the community to enhance the program's capabilities and to furthering Cardano's ecosystem growth and development.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract.

Without targeted investment in tooling and automation, operational overhead will remain high. Streamlining systems now lays the groundwork for a leaner, more cost-effective operation once this development roadmap concludes in 2026.\n\n2. **Low voter engagement:** While Catalyst sees higher voter engagement than most blockchain ecosystems, participation remains disproportionately low relative to the total ADA in circulation. This imbalance raises questions about how representative funding decisions truly are of the broader Cardano community.\n\n3. **Software limitations:** Fragmented tools and inconsistent user workflows create friction across the entire Catalyst journey - from proposal to review to vote to ongoing project-funding administration and transparent outcomes. This complexity deters newcomers and reduces the system's inclusivity and scalability.\n\n4. **Voting power concentration:** A small number of high-stake wallets have the potential to dominate decision-making, leading to concerns around fairness and influence. Planned reforms like Quadratic Voting and DRep delegation are essential steps toward more equitable governance.\n\n5. **Catalyst's early-stage focus:** While Catalyst excels at incubating early-stage ideas and pilot programs, its role is sometimes mistaken for a long-term funding source.

This includes the infrastructure, libraries and documentation.\n\nOur primary focus is on two key projects: The Blockfrost Platform and the Blockfrost Gateway. Both are designed to expand the capabilities of the Icebreaker network.\n\n**Blockfrost Platform**\n\nThe Blockfrost platform is a next-generation backend designed to run on existing SPO relays, utilizing existing resources and rewarding operators with a share of Blockfrost's current revenue by serving our existing customers.\n\n**Blockfrost Gateway**\n\nThe Blockfrost gateway is the entry point for individual SPOs running the Blockfrost platform. Through the gateway, SPOs can receive requests from Blockfrost users. In return for processing these requests, they earn a share of the revenue.\n\nWith the Blockfrost Gateway, anyone can run their own Blockfrost instance with their own platform. We plan to use Hydra to open micro-payment channels between parties, enabling them to exchange ADA or other tokens for their services.\n\nWe are also developing the Solitary mode, which is designed for teams that require full ownership of their environment. Developers and enterprise customers can deploy a customized and independent Blockfrost instance with complete control of the infrastructure, uptime and security.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nBlockfrost is a powerful API platform that gives anyone access to the Cardano Blockchain and functionality without the need to run your own Node. Blockfrost aims to decentralize its Cardano Blockchain API through the Blockfrost Platform and Blockfrost Gateway, enabling a network of Icebreakers operated by SPOs and node operators to process API requests and share revenue. All components are open-sourced to ensure transparency and avoid vendor lock-in.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs.

Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR.

All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.","metadata_motivation":"This proposal aims to solve the following problem:\n\nThe demand for a reliable infrastructure and tools that support development is what led to the creation of Blockfrost. If you have interacted with the Cardano Blockchain, there is a good chance you were interacting with Blockfrost in the background.\n\nBut this level of adoption has come with some trade-offs. At it's peak, Blockfrost was handling over 50% of all on-chain transactions on Cardano. We recognize this concentration is in contrast to the decentralized nature of the blockchain, and have actively been working to decentralize Blockfrost for the benefit of the Cardano community.\n\nTogether with Stake Pool Operators (SPOs) and node operators, we have started the initial phase of what we call the Icebreakers era, an incentivized program designed to decentralize Cardano data access and reward the incredible node operator community.","metadata_references":"[{\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Github budget proposal link request\", \"uri\": \"https://github.com/blockfrost/blockfrost-platform/pull/310\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Github budget proposal rendered version\", \"uri\": \"https://mmahut-2025budget.blockfrost-platform.pages.dev/budget\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Blockfrost.io\", \"uri\": \"https://blockfrost.io/\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Blockfrost platform Github repository\", \"uri\": \"https://github.com/blockfrost/blockfrost-platform\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Icebreakers public Grafana dashboard\", \"uri\": \"https://icebreakers.blockfrost.io/\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Blockfrost.io X account\", \"uri\": \"https://x.com/blockfrost_io\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Project Proposal In Ekklesia\", \"uri\": \"https://2025budget.intersectmbo.org/ballots/680d1b63565577986442d123/proposals/680d1b63565577986442d14a\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Approved Budget Info Action submitted by Intersect\", \"uri\": \"https://gov.tools/outcomes/governance_actions/e14de8d9dc4f4ddf3fe9250a8a926e20f10e99b86bd0610b77d7a054981591ee#0\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Details of all successful proposals (CSV)\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafybeicwrop4q7xvnyjdd5drumbe56sqtm5lbe2ul3c262zt4hgguzdycm\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Automating Accountability: Cardano's Smart Contract Framework Blog\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafybeihqx4ae72z7suqfnxrpqpqithp43cai7o2uuewnqtezgaoyc3ptyq\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Sundae Labs Budget Management Smart Contracts Github Repository\", \"uri\": \"https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Budget Management Smart Contracts TxPipe Audit Report\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafybeiccnwejbgj43wo6hrlseckkkmprtoqc5cfuy2hesm6c6yealwho3e\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Budget Management Smart Contracts MLabs Audit Report\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafybeiah5fnjhda5hemj3qvaehc4mre3qllqzw2l7mkdsguytn4ftgafw4\"}]","metadata_resolved":1,"metadata_hash_valid":1,"proposer_address":"","param_changes":null,"treasury_amount_lovelace":1300000000000,"treasury_recipients":"[{\"stake_address\": \"stake1uxzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6g7lgq9r\", \"amount\": \"1300000000000\"}]","flags":"[]","flag_score":0,"first_seen":"2026-02-09T18:50:25.950966+00:00","last_updated":"2026-02-09T22:00:01.543836+00:00"},

The information provided herein is intended to fulfill the spirit of the constitutional requirement for a treasury withdrawal info action by also providing the details of the proposed solution, alignment to the budget, and amount to be withdrawn from the Cardano Treasury.","metadata_rationale":"### Project Solution\n\nSecuring ongoing funding for Pallas directly benefits the Cardano developer community by ensuring its continued reliability and performance as a key open-source resource for the Cardano ecosystem. Projects like Aiken, Lucid, Mithril, and Amaru already utilize Pallas to streamline development and reduce infrastructure complexity. By maintaining Pallas, we help developers focus on building applications rather than managing low-level blockchain details. This support strengthens the ecosystem's developer tooling, makes it easier for new developers to contribute, and fosters innovation across various Cardano-based projects.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nTxPipe is an active member of the Cardano ecosystem\n\nTxPipe has been developing open-source tools for the Cardano ecosystem for over 3 years and we're not going anywhere. Evidence of our commitment can be found by evaluating the continuous activity of our public code repositories.\n\nExperience developing in the Cardano ecosystem\n\nTxPipe has helped developed several dApps for the Cardano ecosystem. This experience allows us to evaluate the feasibility of the project and its potential benefit from a developer's perspective. We've also participated in development of chains using the released version of the IOG's Partnerchain SDK.\n\nSuccessful Catalyst proposals\n\nWe have successfully completed several Catalyst proposals. This may serve as evidence that our team has the required capabilities to fulfill these type of projects.\n\nDevelopment process will be public and open-source\n\nBoth the output and the development process will be public and open-source. This approach provides an easy way for the Catalyst team and the Cardano community to evaluate the progress at each step of the process.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs.

Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledgebase.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC.

Hundreds of transactions can be submitted as a single batch, reducing the load on the L1. Cardano can achieve higher throughput and lower transaction costs.\n\nzkFold offers to build a general-purpose zero knowledge rollup solution for Cardano. A zero knowledge rollup is a technological layer (Layer 2) on top of a blockchain that increases the blockchain's scalability potential by compressing many transactions into transaction batches. As batches offer a greater degree of information compression, it is reasonable to expect that hundreds of rollup smart contract transactions might fit into a single Cardano mainnet transaction. Zero knowledge proofs technology places a limit on the cost of on-chain verification of the validity of transaction batches.

This reduces congestion, benefiting users by ensuring faster and more efficient dApp interactions.\n\n- Lower Transaction Costs: By reducing the number of transactions directly processed on-chain, ZK rollups lower the transaction fees, making Cardano more accessible and affordable, especially for smaller transactions or micro-payments.\n\n- Enhanced User Experience: Lower fees create a smoother experience for users interacting with dApps, decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, and NFT marketplaces.\n\n- Increased Adoption: ZK rollups can make the Cardano ecosystem more attractive for developers and users, promoting the growth of dApps, DeFi, and other blockchain applications by offering higher performance and scalability.\n\n- Maintained Security: ZK rollups allow for scalability improvements without compromising the security and decentralization of the Cardano base layer, as Cardano still plays the role of the settlement layer for the rollup transactions.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nzkFold team has successfully moving towards the TestNet of our ZK Rollup. The zkFold team consists of expert Haskell, Rust, and ZKP developers and Cryptographers.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract.

Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR.

While the introduction of a constitution and on-chain voting forms the structural backbone, these mechanisms alone are not enough to sustain a functional decentralized system. What's needed in parallel is community-aligned coordination - infrastructure that enables participation, promotes continuity, and supports informed decision-making across the network.\n\nIntersect is also responsible for the stewardship of Cardano's core Haskell codebases, including the repositories that power the core Cardano node. This role involves more than maintenance - it includes coordinating new releases, aligning contributors around engineering best practices, and ensuring that upgrades are ready for safe deployment. Intersect acts as a neutral facilitator in this process, helping translate new feature proposals from ecosystem vendors into stable, tested releases that can be confidently adopted across the network.\n\nIntersect has played a central role in coordinating ecosystem-wide upgrades, including the successful deployment of the Chang and Plomin hard forks. These upgrades required aligning infrastructure providers, SPOs, dApps, and exchanges globally - a process demanding deep technical coordination, ecosystem trust, and communications capacity.\n\nBeyond technical infrastructure, Intersect provides a collaborative space for governance to mature and grow, supporting over 30 working groups and eight elected committees made up of Cardano community members. These committees focus on key areas such as budgeting, product development, open source, membership, growth, and technical standards - offering non-binding recommendations and practical insight to on-chain actors like DReps and SPOs.","metadata_references":"[{\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Intersect Development Update 2024 (PDF)\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafybeib6z3yueyblhr6nlzszxphcjljmse2uhahnpp2hrueodhbha4xonq\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Intersect and CDH 2024 Financial Report (PDF)\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafybeianvsd4avrdn6r4ietmv6vnv6ocfeqptc4k76ifs27c3i6p5nf6mm\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Intersect Knowledge Base\", \"uri\": \"https://docs.intersectmbo.org/\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Intersect Website\", \"uri\": \"https://www.intersectmbo.org/\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Intersect Committees via Knowledge Base\", \"uri\": \"https://committees.docs.intersectmbo.org/\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Intersect Board via Knowledge Base\", \"uri\": \"https://board.docs.intersectmbo.org/\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Project Proposal In Ekklesia\", \"uri\": \"https://2025budget.intersectmbo.org/ballots/680d1b63565577986442d123/proposals/680d1b63565577986442d1ec\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Approved Budget Info Action submitted by Intersect via GovTool\", \"uri\": \"https://gov.tools/outcomes/governance_actions/e14de8d9dc4f4ddf3fe9250a8a926e20f10e99b86bd0610b77d7a054981591ee#0\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Details of all successful proposals (CSV)\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafybeicwrop4q7xvnyjdd5drumbe56sqtm5lbe2ul3c262zt4hgguzdycm\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Automating Accountability: Cardano's Smart Contract Framework Blog\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafybeihqx4ae72z7suqfnxrpqpqithp43cai7o2uuewnqtezgaoyc3ptyq\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Sundae Labs Budget Management Smart Contracts Github Repository\", \"uri\": \"https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Budget Management Smart Contracts TxPipe Audit Report\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafybeiccnwejbgj43wo6hrlseckkkmprtoqc5cfuy2hesm6c6yealwho3e\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Budget Management Smart Contracts MLabs Audit Report\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafybeiah5fnjhda5hemj3qvaehc4mre3qllqzw2l7mkdsguytn4ftgafw4\"}]","metadata_resolved":1,"metadata_hash_valid":1,"proposer_address":"","param_changes":null,"treasury_amount_lovelace":15750000000000,"treasury_recipients":"[{\"stake_address\": \"stake1uxzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6g7lgq9r\", \"amount\": \"15750000000000\"}]","flags":"[]","flag_score":0,"first_seen":"2026-02-09T18:50:25.950966+00:00","last_updated":"2026-02-09T22:00:01.543836+00:00"},

Wallet Support for Cardano Native Assets: USDA is pursuing strategic partnerships with firms like Zoida Markets, and in talks with BitGo, Zodia Custody, CipherBC, etc. Our goal is to enhance Cardano Native Assets by improving reach, reliability, and pricing through collaboration with key custodians, and wallet infrastructure providers---ultimately boosting distribution, liquidity and user adoption.\n\nb. Availability of USDA / Native Assets on Exchanges, OTC Desks and NEO Banks: Anzens is focused on bringing USDA to CEXs, NEO banks, OTC desks, and other key distributors to expand its reach. By enabling USDA pairs for Cardano tokens on exchanges, we aim to boost usability, drive adoption through spot listings, and support broader participation via derivatives trading. Enabling USDA with NEO banks would offer USDA <> Fiat pairs in exotic currencies\n\nc. Drive USDA adoption to unlock real-world utility: Anzens would be initiating cross integration with real estate developers, remittance companies and other payment companies to bring USDA as part of their backend settlement network, helping Cardano gain adoption beyond the crypto space.\n\nd. Access to Fiat on and off-ramps: Encryptus has piloted ADA-to-fiat off-ramps for Yoroi Wallet users, enabling users to convert ADA to local currencies across 70+ countries---including India, China, Philippines, Nigeria etc---via bank transfers, without relying on SWIFT or card networks. Encryptus aims to build stronger on-ramps with local payment rails.\n\nThe funds from this proposal would be utilized to:\n\n1. Develop Onramp Capabilities: Current ADA onramps via cards are costly and don't support Cardano Native Assets. Encryptus aims to solve this by offering low-cost onramps through local bank transfers and mobile wallets---cutting costs by up to 60%. This will ease access to ADA and native assets. Ideal for Cardano DeFi and wider eco-system. Phase 1 of the services would include countries in LATAM, Africa and parts of Asia with a Phase 2 expansion to developed economies.\n\n2. Cardano's deterministic fee structure makes it well-suited for payment use cases. However, integration with traditional payment systems has been a challenge. Encryptus is addressing this by developing alternative payment solutions---such as global bill payments, school fees, and Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) products---on the Cardano blockchain. These initiatives showcase Cardano's practical value to Web2 users, helping to broaden its adoption and real-world relevance.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nOur team brings together seasoned professionals with deep expertise in payments, stablecoins, and cryptocurrency infrastructure, backed by 50 years of combined experience at leading firms such as Paxos, Huobi (HTX), OKX, Western Union, Citi Bank, and BitPesa (AZA Finance).

Lack of Wallet & Custodian Support for Cardano Native Assets:\n\nMajor institutional custodians (e.g BitGo, Fireblocks) do not natively support Cardano native assets, including USDA. This creates a bottleneck for exchanges, OTC desks and institutions who rely on these custodians for secure asset storage. Without custodian integration:\n\n-Exchanges cannot list Cardano-native assets, limiting liquidity and trading opportunities\n\n-Institutional investors face custody risks, reducing their willingness to engage with Cardano Ecosystem\n\n-Cardano projects struggle to attract capital, as investors prefer assets with established custody solutions\n\nImpact:The absence of institutional-grade custody solutions stifles liquidity, restricts market access and slows Cardano's growth.\n\n2. Limited Availability of Cardano Native Assets on Exchanges & OTC Desks:\n\nDespite Cardano's $700M+ DeFi ecosystem, its native assets---including stablecoins---are severely underrepresented on centralized exchanges (CEXs) and OTC desks.\n\n-Few trading pairs for Cardano assets (eg. ADA/USDA, USDA/USDT)\n\n-No derivatives markets (futures, options) for Cardano stablecoins, limiting trading volumes\n\n-OTC desks avoid Cardano-native assets due to limited institutional LPs\n\nImpact: Without deep exchange liquidity, traders and institutions cannot efficiently enter or exit positions\n\n3. Lack of Real-World Stablecoin Utility Beyond Crypto Trading:\n\nStablecoins mainly serve crypto trading, with USDC gaining enterprise use---while Cardano's stablecoins remain underutilized across real-world sectors:\n\n-Cross-border B2B payments ($31.6 trillion market)\n\n-Remittances ($850 billion market and where low fees matter)\n\n-Payroll & merchant settlements\n\nCardano's low fee structure makes it ideal for payments, but the lack of integration with traditional finance, prevents adoption.\n\nImpact: Without real-world use cases, Cardano's stablecoins are limited to DeFi\n\n4. Restricted Fiat On/Off-Ramp, Especially in Frontier Markets:\n\nUsers in emerging markets (Africa, LATAM, Asia) struggle to convert ADA and Cardano-native assets into local fiat due to:\n\n-High fees (5-7% for card-based ramps vs. ~1% for local bank transfers\n\n-Limited payout network & banking access\n\nImpact: Limited DeFi participation and slow retail adoption due to costly on/off ramps.\n\nEthereum & Ripple are expanding stablecoin adoption. Without custody solutions, Cardano misses institutional demand. Stablecoins will reshape global finance, and frontier markets need blockchain.","metadata_references":"[{\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Off-ramping (ADA to Fiat) live withdrawal on Yoroi wallet\", \"uri\": \"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1znnLuN1r0pB8-c10Txf36QPpV3IwBf0x/view?t=3\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"The Payment Network and Methods by country\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafybeihyzc6lqfzdiy2ooydi53kqhgik2wqsdp5ctyjqaswf6eiar5nihi\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Anzens Minting USDA\", \"uri\": \"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PdOplE6cDJsTuGknsNtPNF7sVsEbNyVV/view?usp=sharing\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Anzens Burning USDA\", \"uri\": \"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v07mt7V3lEGWH19teM-qhEJXI4e7ZCXs/view?usp=sharing\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Response to Comment 1.

Building on Cardano's robust foundation---including a proven record of 100% uptime---the proposal is guided by a Strategic Research Agenda rooted in an Evidence-Based Methodology. With a focus on scalability, sustainability, and interoperability, this approach ensures a rigorous, market readiness methodology. It covers conceptual design through to implementation, resulting in a consistent pipeline of high-quality, validated innovations that provide enduring benefit to the Cardano platform.\n\nCardano Vision is an ambitious five-year research initiative spanning nine thematic focus areas, organized into structured annual work programs. Its purpose is to solidify Cardano's position as a leader in blockchain innovation. Achieving this vision requires breakthroughs in critical technologies, including next-generation consensus protocols like Ouroboros Omega, zero-knowledge proofs, quantum-resistant cryptography, and advanced smart contract capabilities. These advancements will equip Cardano to address global challenges while upholding the highest standards of security, efficiency, and innovation.\n\nThis strategic approach delivers broad impact---strengthening Cardano's global research leadership and producing tangible outputs such as academic papers, technical recommendations, and validated prototypes. Commercializing deep technologies like Web3 cannot rely solely on market demand; it depends on sustained scientific and technical excellence. Without proactive investment, valuable opportunities may be lost. Critical infrastructure must also undergo rigorous research and validation, as flaws can compromise network security or endanger user assets. By focusing on high-potential R&D areas, this initiative builds a strong foundation for innovation, accelerates time to market, and drives meaningful economic and societal outcomes.","metadata_references":"[{\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Input Output Research (IOR): Cardano Vision - Work Program 2025 Proposal v1.0 (PDF)\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafybeif7iuv7k37vz4wm2ylaunuxq2fnpsqksyh4xrebdc2n4hzwwvjica\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Input Output Research (IOR): Work Program 2025 - Proposed Fundamental Research Streams v1.0\", \"uri\": \"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XtragK8dfzXbdVruo5X063ziBVd_R8Tz_05DapRt380/edit?gid=1979892956#gid=1979892956\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Input Output Research (IOR): Work Program 2025 - Proposed Technology Validation Streams v1.0\", \"uri\": \"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BRPJoJ0s2Q1C1uswIejYmvUNAPIcnPohrh8ITT97my0/edit?gid=0#gid=0\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"25.04 Intersect - Product Committee - Research Working Group - Cardano Vision v1.06\", \"uri\": \"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1B2MX1BlYJu5xa6KRix2vd_inTAAQLmoVINVrIb2oYzw/edit#slide=id.g314bec4086b_0_904\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Project Proposal In Ekklesia\", \"uri\": \"https://2025budget.intersectmbo.org/ballots/680d1b63565577986442d123/proposals/680d1b63565577986442d20e\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Approved Budget Info Action submitted by Intersect via GovTool\", \"uri\": \"https://gov.tools/outcomes/governance_actions/e14de8d9dc4f4ddf3fe9250a8a926e20f10e99b86bd0610b77d7a054981591ee#0\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Details of all successful proposals (CSV)\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafybeicwrop4q7xvnyjdd5drumbe56sqtm5lbe2ul3c262zt4hgguzdycm\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Automating Accountability: Cardano's Smart Contract Framework Blog\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafybeihqx4ae72z7suqfnxrpqpqithp43cai7o2uuewnqtezgaoyc3ptyq\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Sundae Labs Budget Management Smart Contracts Github Repository\", \"uri\": \"https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Budget Management Smart Contracts TxPipe Audit Report\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafybeiccnwejbgj43wo6hrlseckkkmprtoqc5cfuy2hesm6c6yealwho3e\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Budget Management Smart Contracts MLabs Audit Report\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafybeiah5fnjhda5hemj3qvaehc4mre3qllqzw2l7mkdsguytn4ftgafw4\"}]","metadata_resolved":1,"metadata_hash_valid":1,"proposer_address":"","param_changes":null,"treasury_amount_lovelace":26840000000000,"treasury_recipients":"[{\"stake_address\": \"stake1uxzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6g7lgq9r\", \"amount\": \"26840000000000\"}]","flags":"[]","flag_score":0,"first_seen":"2026-02-09T18:50:25.950966+00:00","last_updated":"2026-02-09T22:00:01.543836+00:00"},

Python is one of the most popular programming languages known. On top of this we provide the security guarantees that are the reason for the Cardano community to embrace functional programming - thus offering an accessible and easy to start with alternative to current languages.\n\nOpShin is aimed at developers that want to build on Cardano. It drastically simplifies onboarding when experience in Python is given, and even without is easy to read and access.\n\nBy making development of Smart Contracts more accessible, OpShin is a key catalyst for a growing ecosystem of DApps on Cardano. The benefit to the community is immense.\n\nThe project is under ongoing development. The language itself is already completed and production ready, but the Smart Contract Ecosystem is always evolving (i.e. new Plutus versions, standards, CIPs). This evolution requires continuous adaptations. The proposal is enough to fund further development for one year. There are no fixed deliverables as it is hard to predict the changes in the ecosystem.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nThe main proposer, Niels, has already bootstrapped the main part of the project. In its current form the tool is able to be used and already being used. The proposer is completely doxed and well-known in the Community.\n\nHe also has a strong network of competent and experienced developers interested and capable in supporting the project.\n\nHe is supported on a per-demand basis by contributors to OpShin such as Julius Frost and S.C. Musson, who have redeemed themselves by contributing valuable improvements.\n\nThe main goal of this proposal is to improve usability and developer experience with respect to Smart Contracts on Cardano. With the given funds, the continued development of the toolchain is secured as developers can be hired to tackle basic issues in the toolchain whereas the main proposer is able to allocate more time of the day towards developing OpShin himself.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH.

This independence makes PyCardano lightweight and easy to set up across various environments. ​\n\nDeveloping PyCardano addresses the challenges mentioned above by providing a native Python library tailored for the Cardano blockchain. This initiative aims to lower the entry barrier for Python developers, fostering a more inclusive and diverse developer community. By eliminating the need for third-party serialization tools, PyCardano simplifies the development workflow, enhancing both efficiency and reliability. This project not only broadens the accessibility of Cardano to a wider range of developers but also encourages innovation and the creation of new applications within the ecosystem.​\n\nBy implementing this proposal, we anticipate the following outcomes:\n\nSustained Compatibility: PyCardano will remain compatible with the latest Cardano protocol versions, enabling developers to build and maintain applications without disruption.​ Although there isn't a clearly specified roadmap or hardfork for Cardano in the next 12 months, we know it is likely that there will be Leios and Midnight integration. These integration and changes will more or less require corresponding updates in PyCardano.\n\n[https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/ouroboros-leios-design-goals-and-concepts/](https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/ouroboros-leios-design-goals-and-concepts/)\n\n[https://midnight.network/](https://midnight.network/)\n\nImproved Stability: Ongoing maintenance and prompt bug fixes will enhance the library's stability and reliability.​\n\nEnhanced Developer Experience: Up-to-date documentation and community support will provide a more accessible and user-friendly experience for developers.​\n\nCommunity Growth: Active engagement with the developer community will foster collaboration, innovation, and the broader adoption of PyCardano.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nJerry, the creator of PyCardano, will lead this project. His deep understanding of both the library and Cardano's ecosystem makes him uniquely qualified to oversee this upgrade.\n\nJerry's experience as a blockchain developer ensures that the technical challenges of aligning with the Chang hardfork can be effectively addressed.\n\nTrack Record:\n\nThe success of PyCardano, with over 170 dependent projects on GitHub and 7,000+ monthly downloads, demonstrates our team's ability to create and maintain critical infrastructure for the Cardano ecosystem.\n\nThe active Discord community (100+ members) shows our ongoing engagement with users and our ability to address their needs.\n\nTechnical Expertise:\n\nOur team's familiarity with Cardano's protocol, combined with expertise in Python development, positions us to efficiently implement the necessary upgrades.\n\nWe have a history of successfully adapting PyCardano to previous Cardano updates, showcasing our ability to respond to network changes.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract.

Funding covers regular maintenance to ensure compatibility with Cardano node updates and the Nix ecosystem, bug fixes, and minor enhancements to improve the tooling based on community needs and developments in related areas like Nix Flakes*.*\n\nThis Treasury Withdrawal is submitted by Intersect on behalf of the vendor. The following sections; Abstract, Motivation, Rationale and Vendor Profile have been sourced from the approved proposal submitted by the Vendor as part of the Intersect budget process.\n\nThis treasury withdrawal funds one of 39 proposals to give effect to the approved budget info action for ₳275,269,340, administered by Intersect via gov_action1u9x73kwufaxa70lfy59g4ynwyrcsaxdcd0gxzzmh67s9fxq4j8hqqk2phgh. The information provided herein is intended to fulfill the spirit of the constitutional requirement for a treasury withdrawal info action by also providing the details of the proposed solution, alignment to the budget, and amount to be withdrawn from the Cardano Treasury.","metadata_rationale":"### Project Solution\n\nFunding this proposal ensures the Cardano community continues to have access to a maintained and reliable Cardano.nix toolset. This benefits anyone deploying Cardano infrastructure (nodes, wallets, explorers) using Nix, including SPOs, developers, and enterprises. The value lies in providing reproducible, robust deployment methods, reducing configuration errors and setup time. The ROI is improved infrastructure reliability, easier onboarding for Nix users into Cardano, and support for key ecosystem players like IOG and the Daedalus Wallet team.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nMLabs LTD is the primary developer and maintainer of Cardano.nix. Our team possesses deep expertise in Nix, Cardano infrastructure deployment, and maintaining complex build systems, evidenced by the successful delivery and maintenance of Cardano.nix and its use by key ecosystem entities.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledgebase.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.","metadata_motivation":"This proposal aims to solve the following problem:\n\nCardano.nix provides foundational toolsets for building and deploying Cardano infrastructure reproducibly using Nix.

It aims to improve the network's overall accessibility and robustness without compromising its safety and security.\n\nThis treasury withdrawal of ₳1.5M follows a previously submitted and now approved [budget proposal](https://explorer.cardano.org/tx/bd488931f792651fefa9c6fda185a2c6cec83245b51d994e33090ce36e29cc26). It is split across five script addresses each covering a scope of a work (ledger, consensus, mercenaries and marketing) and a contingency reserve.","metadata_rationale":"## Administration of the budget\n\nThe [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) maintainer committee ensures **direct administration** of its budget, assisted by an **on-chain smart contract**. Off-chain, the fund management, responsibilities and remuneration of contributors follow [PRAGMA's Maintainer Committee Framework](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafkreiabxyva5lfm6zztg7tnktxvvbbucljrce7hlrp4p6hropqzfaip3y). Additionally, the smart contract's role is to ensure that funds are expended under the scope of work defined in this budget and authorized by the relevant scope owners.\n\nOur [final solution](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru-treasury) is built as an extension of the treasury management contract [presented by Sundae Labs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDSoc4sNxbM) in the context of a mission for Intersect. Our additions enable, most importantly, the dynamic definition of scope owners and their adjustment if necessary (e.g., key loss, departure, death) upon approval by the PRAGMA general assembly (requiring 5 signatures out of 5 members).\n\nWhile already [extensively](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru-treasury/blob/main/validators/permissions.test.ak) [tested](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru-treasury/blob/main/validators/traps.test.ak), our final solution is still being audited at the moment of writing this proposal. We do not wish to rush the auditors or take any risk regarding treasury management. \n\nHowever, due to time constraints stemming from the need to continue paying contributors whose payroll expires in the upcoming weeks, we have decided to proceed with a simplified setup and migrate to our final setup once it is ready.\n\nThe simplified setup relies entirely on the [initial solution designed and developed by Sundae Labs](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/), which has been extensively tested and fully audited by two independent parties (attached as external references to this proposal). We have also audited, tested and experimented with this solution on our own.\n\n### Initial setup\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pragma-org/amaru-treasury/fdf1981246cac9802c95191aec68a63567b73eed/.github/img/treasury-simplified-overview-dark.jpg)\n\nWe define 5 Amaru treasuries: one for each scope of work and one for the contingency budget. \n\nThe same smart contract governs each treasury, although it is configured differently in each case. It ensures funds coming from either UTxOs or reward accounts move according to specific operations with a precise semantic:\n\n- **reorganize**: allows for the collection and combination of multiple sources (e.g., multiple UTxOs) into another distribution with at least as many assets. This action is typically used to consolidate multiple UTxOs into a single one for easier treasury management.\n\n- **sweep**: after an agreed-upon expiration date, allows sending all ada leftovers (unconsumed budgets) back to the Cardano's treasury. Any native asset (e.g. USDM) is kept within the contract. The action can also be triggered at an earlier stage through a specific authorization.\n\n- **disburse**: allow payment of funds (ada or native assets) into an arbitrary address, up until the budget's expiration date. Only native assets can be disbursed beyond the expiration date to allow converting them back to ada.\n\n- **fund**: disburse funds into another set of on-chain validators ('vendors') pre-configured with a payment schedule. **We will not make use of this operation. It is fully disabled in our setup**. Disbursement will only happen through the _disburse_ action.\n\nIn addition to rules specified as part of the smart contract, each operation also defines a set of permissions. Permissions can take the form of a multisig or another script. \n\nIn the initial setup, we configure **each treasury** with permissions as follows:\n\n- The **reorganize** operation can be fully authorized by the respective scope owner alone. In the case of the _contingency_ budget, any scope owner is capable of authorizing a 'reorganize' operation. \n\n- The **sweep** operation requires 3 out of 4 authorizations until the end of 2025. It can be performed by *any ada holder* after that date.\n\n- **disburse** operation requires 3 out of 4 authorizations until the end of 2025. Disbursement of ada is forbidden after that date.  \n\n- The **fund** operation is entirely disabled using a permission setting that is impossible to satisfy.\n\n\n### Final setup\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pragma-org/amaru-treasury/8a6782c277e5ae6cc2ea446711bc33b6b56892ce/.github/img/treasury-overview-dark.jpg)\n\nIn a second phase, once the external audit has been finalized and our confidence in the contract is sufficient, we'll move towards our final vision for the 2025 budget management. This second solution is still smart-contract-based and builds upon the initial solution. \n\nIt is motivated by the desire to allow rotating credentials associated with scope owners to cope with two main issues:\n\n1. the loss of key from a scope owner;\n2. the departure of a scope owner from the project.\n\nRelying on a rigid setup which statically defines the scope owners is risky and unpractical. So instead, we recognize the following additional capabilities to the final solution:\n\n- **Credential rotation**: In case of loss of credentials or departure of a scope owner, a mechanism allows rotating credentials to new scope owners upon approval by all (5 out of 5) PRAGMA members.\n\n## Financial audit\n\nThe _'ad-hoc'_ scope of work makes provision for a financial auditor who will be picked at a later stage. \n\nTo facilitate the work of the auditor, we will attach metadata with key `1694` to transactions spending from the smart contracts, in accordance with [CIP-100](https://cips.cardano.org/cip/CIP-0100).\n\nInitial metadata describing each _Initial Setup(s)_ have already been published and are visible on-chain.\n\n| Scope / Budget | Transaction Id |\n| ---          | ---            | \n| Ledger       | [`cd25ce7b027fea4e28d5075691aa5822baa859bc74cc79db0377043bc9f383c7`](explorer.cardano.org/preview/tx/cd25ce7b027fea4e28d5075691aa5822baa859bc74cc79db0377043bc9f383c7) | \n| Consensus    | [`e5be93f2530c51e0b1582e5a0e99ccb1235e4395a41c7196d06c4daea3eafe66`](explorer.cardano.org/preview/tx/e5be93f2530c51e0b1582e5a0e99ccb1235e4395a41c7196d06c4daea3eafe66) |\n| Mercenaries  | [`0729a234e4e12b945f06189ca479681e49ffcc116fb3713720bada72180fe27c`](explorer.cardano.org/preview/tx/0729a234e4e12b945f06189ca479681e49ffcc116fb3713720bada72180fe27c) | \n| Marketing    | [`5697f433442317f04f539baecdf71fee01b3e8453c658a4d782648bc1e4f4490`](explorer.cardano.org/preview/tx/5697f433442317f04f539baecdf71fee01b3e8453c658a4d782648bc1e4f4490) | \n| Contingency  | [`44ae2c263b2115023e4b137f718549fcac78c0a59b7983e918d9e79d1a503b3c`](explorer.cardano.org/preview/tx/44ae2c263b2115023e4b137f718549fcac78c0a59b7983e918d9e79d1a503b3c) | \n\nTo further ease this process for the least technologically inclined, we will also collect in [a publicly available journal](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru-treasury/tree/main/journal#journal) an audit log of these transactions and a human-readable version of their metadata. \n\n## Constitutionality self-assessment\n\nBeing one of the first proposals of this nature ever submitted, it is easy to get things wrong. To convince ourselves of its constitutionality, we thought it relevant to include a checklist of the points we cover and, for each, our interpretation of the Cardano Constitution. \n\n#### Purpose\n\n- [x] This proposal is for work intended to enhance the security, decentralization and long-term sustainability of Cardano.\n\n#### Article III.5: on-chain governance process\n\n- [x] We have submitted this proposal in a standardized, legible format, which includes a URL and hash of all documented off-chain content. We believe our rationale to be detailed and sufficient. The proposal includes a title, abstract, rationale for the proposal, and relevant supporting materials.\n\n#### Article IV.1: budgets\n\n- [x] This proposal gives effect to the [previously presented and agreed upon budget](https://explorer.cardano.org/tx/9b62b3c632f329016a968ac25211825bb4f84b12461121c7da3aa11df92370f9), as indicated in this provision. \n\n#### Article IV.2: funds administration\n\n- [x] This proposal specifies an administrator in accordance with this provision. It also specifies an internal administration process using smart contracts and an off-chain overseeing committee, meeting the requirements of this clause, which requires a process that may include an administrator.\n\n#### Article IV.3: net-change limit\n\n- [x] Being of ₳1.5M and taking place mid-2025, this withdrawal request does not violate the [currently agreed upon Net-Change Limit](https://explorer.cardano.org/tx/9b62b3c632f329016a968ac25211825bb4f84b12461121c7da3aa11df92370f9).\n\n#### Article IV.4: auditor & contractual obligations\n\n- [x] This proposal makes provisions for a financial auditor (covered by the _'ad-hoc'_ scope). The auditor will be picked at a later stage, and their work will be facilitated through the publication of metadata alongside any movement of funds out of the smart contracts.\n\n- [x] Our off-chain legal framework knwon as [PRAGMA's Maintainer Committee Framework](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafkreiabxyva5lfm6zztg7tnktxvvbbucljrce7hlrp4p6hropqzfaip3y) makes provision for a dispute resolution for contractors receiving an allocation in the context of this treasury withdrawal. It explicitly states that _\"Any dispute arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts of Zurich\"_. \n\n#### Article IV.5: vesting rules\n\n- [x] The use of intermediary smart contracts is used prior to any disbursement of funds to beneficiaries. In particular, we intend to attach on-chain metadata to facilitate financial audits.\n\n- [x] Our on-chain smart contract solution simultaneously enforces that:\n  1. funds (at the contract) cannot be delegated to an SPO; and\n  2. funds (at the contract) shall be delegated to an auto-abstain DRep.\n  \n  Note that we cannot prevent others from creating undelegated UTxOs at the contract's address. Yet, the contract stipulates that the outputs of each operation (e.g., reorganize) carry delegation rights in accordance with this provision.\n\n#### Guardrails\n\n- [x] TREASURY-01a - There's is currently an [approved Net-Change limit](https://explorer.cardano.org/tx/9b62b3c632f329016a968ac25211825bb4f84b12461121c7da3aa11df92370f9) of ₳350,000,000 finishing at the conclusion of Epoch 604 in December 2025.\n\n- [x] TREASURY-02a - At the moment of proposing this, there hasn't been any enacted treasury withdrawal for the current period covered by the Net-Change limit. Being of ₳1.5M, this withdrawal is, at the moment of proposing it, within the Net-Change Limit. \n\n- [x] TREASURY-03a - This withdrawal is denominated in ada.\n\n- [x] TREASURY-04a - This withdrawal follows a [budget proposal](https://explorer.cardano.org/tx/bd488931f792651fefa9c6fda185a2c6cec83245b51d994e33090ce36e29cc26) that the DReps have agreed on with a threshold of greater than 50% of the active voting stake.\n\n## Notations & definitions\n\n- We denote 'ADA' as `₳` throughout this proposal. We may use either notation interchangeably. \n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) project represents a major step towards node diversity through the development of a modular, high-performance, and interoperable block-producing node for Cardano. Our approach, rooted in openness, innovation, and operational resilience, aims to deliver significant advancements in blockchain technology without compromising on security.\n\nThis withdrawal aims to clearly outline a transparent budget management process, leveraging the capabilities of our chain to enforce this process as reasonably possible in the given timeframe. \n\nBeing an ongoing project, [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) comes with its own set of constraints. Yet, we try our best to pioneer what we think could be one of Cardano's most pivotal moments.","metadata_motivation":"## Who we are\n\n[Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) is a multi-entity effort that currently sits under [PRAGMA](https://pragma.io): a member-based, not-for-profit association for open-source blockchain software projects. Five members with equal power currently drive PRAGMA's strategy and operations: Blink Labs, Cardano Foundation, dcSpark, Sundae Labs, and TxPipe. Each of them has a proven track record of building on Cardano and supporting our ecosystem.\n\n[Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru/graphs/contributors) itself is managed by an appointed maintainer committee in charge of different scopes. Each member of the maintainer committee is responsible for a scope of work and has oversight of its delivery, which includes managing the associated budget. The current maintainer committee comprises of:\n\n- [Matthias Benkort](https://github.com/ktorz) responsible for the **ledger & overall architecture** with a budget of 1.5 FTEs (**`₳300,000`**) until end of 2025.\n\n  Managing treasury at: [`stake17xnev6rc25xwz8kg4qae8lq6dcg964z00py5gqgxd387pncv8fq8g`](https://cardanoscan.io/stakeKey/stake17xnev6rc25xwz8kg4qae8lq6dcg964z00py5gqgxd387pncv8fq8g)\n\n- [Arnaud Bailly](https://github.com/abailly) responsible for the **consensus and simulation testing**, with a budget of 1.5 FTEs (**`₳300,000`**) until end of 2025.\n  \n  Managing treasury at: [`stake17xd74ehu0l4d5mx0sfz4fd0r5jvw4v2jqkkfyjxrlwvnkhccrqj9l`](https://cardanoscan.io/stakeKey/stake17xd74ehu0l4d5mx0sfz4fd0r5jvw4v2jqkkfyjxrlwvnkhccrqj9l)\n\n- [Pi Lanningham](https://github.com/Quantumplation) responsible for the **ad hoc work and middleware integrations** (a.k.a mercenaries) with a budget of 2.5 FTEs (**`₳500,000`**) until end of 2025.\n\n  Managing treasury at: [`stake17xrh74lqhhxgzelfsn0wq5kcm4e5dmluprlcpg5mq30p5yqhgk7k8`](https://cardanoscan.io/stakeKey/stake17xrh74lqhhxgzelfsn0wq5kcm4e5dmluprlcpg5mq30p5yqhgk7k8)\n\n- [Damien Czapla](https://github.com/Dam-CZ) responsible for the **project management, public relations & marketing** with a budget of 0.5 FTE (**`₳100,000`**) until end of 2025.\n\n  Managing treasury at: [`stake17xrqac8khkprtpp2jz90mpkujjwye8dt6a9sjewrvjudx9ggg4u5y`](https://cardanoscan.io/stakeKey/stake17xrqac8khkprtpp2jz90mpkujjwye8dt6a9sjewrvjudx9ggg4u5y)\n\n- [Santiago Carmuega](https://github.com/scarmuega) responsible for the **p2p networking**. Santiago oversees **no part of the treasury budget** whatsoever related to Amaru in 2025. The networking's funding has been fully secured through other mechanisms.\n\nAdditionally, Arnaud, Matthias, Pi and Damien are collectively responsible for the _contingency_ scope with a budget of **`₳300,000`** until the end of 2025, corresponding to 25% of the sum of all other budgets as outlined in the [budget proposal](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafkreibqma7t2k4rcywvx5afukahhi3dp2so2ugh7t4ljuawhanvk7sr34).\n\nThe contingency treasury's stake address is: [`stake178jztxzwynajcp4dva5gy9udmmnwg7ueffvf4c7hpjqhc7gtj5nzz`](https://cardanoscan.io/stakeKey/stake178jztxzwynajcp4dva5gy9udmmnwg7ueffvf4c7hpjqhc7gtj5nzz)\n\n---\n\nIn total, we request **`₳1,500,000`** (1.5M ADA).\n\n---\n\n> **NOTES**\n>\n> 1. Efforts are estimated in FTE (Full-Time Employee) valued at $200K / ₳400K per annum.\n>\n> 2. As outlined in the initial budget proposal, the withdrawal requests only account for resources that aren't currently covered by other means (e.g. sponsorship, employee payroll, Catalyst, ...). In particular, every scope owner highlighted above is fully covered **outside** of this withdrawal.\n\n## Building an alternative node\n\n[Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) provides an alternative perspective and solution for both stake pool operators and developers, prioritizing a modular approach, a seamless user experience, and low hardware requirements. Additionally, the project is primarily implemented in Rust, which is well-suited for high assurance, thereby attracting new contributors to the core maintenance of the ecosystem.\n\nFor more details, please refer to the [budget proposal](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafybeicyqwjcg4x52l4ml5ocjlqnproqdjgfbguxdge4saxxvu2hidzvpq) which already covers in great length the project, its goals, its deliverables and its methodology\n\n## Why request funds from Cardano's treasury\n\n### Decentralized core infrastructure\n\nBlock-producing nodes (a.k.a. stake pools) and relays are at the heart of Cardano's infrastructure. Together, they constitute and support the Cardano network. [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) aims at offering an alternative piece to this core infrastructure, thus becoming part of this core infrastructure. We firmly believe that decentralizing the core infrastructure—without disrupting its operational resilience—is a necessary step toward a more robust and secure network.\n\nAdditionally, supporting the blockchain base layer should be a shared responsibility. Stakepool operators already share the burden of operating the network, and it is time to share the responsibility for its development and technical evolution. [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) makes a significant leap in sharing this responsibility, not only by incrementally delivering a capable block-producing node for the network but also by paving the way for those who come after through documentation, conformance tests and engineering specifications.\n\nBy its very nature, [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) is a project that aligns with Cardano's vision. As a core infrastructure component, it is also challenging and undesirable to articulate a business model around the project without compromising its essence. We believe that because of these reasons, [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) qualifies for treasury withdrawals.\n\n### Open source & neutrality\n\nThe project is, of course, open source. We have linked [the code repository](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) throughout this document and referred to it also in the original budget proposal. As outlined in the budget proposal, not only is the code public, but the project's progress, evolutions, and decisions are also publicly available. The team strives to remain accessible through public forums and regular touchpoints open to all.\n\nThe core team comprises individuals from various entities and backgrounds. And, while not obvious, this is a situation very dear to us. To preserve Amaru's neutrality and openness, we must ensure that core contributors are not tied to a single actor. Cardano's treasury offers a perfect solution to this problem as it virtually represents a source of funding that is _\"everyone and no one at the same time\"_.\n\nReceiving funding from the Cardano treasury makes the [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) team accountable towards the Cardano community. It turns the Cardano community into our ultimate stakeholder, which is both good and desirable for a project of this nature.","metadata_references":"[{\"@language\": \"en\", \"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Proposed (and approved) budget - gov_action1h4ygjv0hjfj3lmafcm76rpdzcm8vsvj9k5wejn3npyxwxm3fesnqqw9kxxz\", \"uri\": \"web+cardano://transaction/bd488931f792651fefa9c6fda185a2c6cec83245b51d994e33090ce36e29cc26\"}, {\"@language\": \"en\", \"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Current Net-Change Limit - gov_action1nd3t833j7v5sz65k3tp9yyvztw60sjcjgcgjr37682s3m7frwrusqmd2k80\", \"uri\": \"web+cardano://transaction/9b62b3c632f329016a968ac25211825bb4f84b12461121c7da3aa11df92370f9\"}, {\"@language\": \"ja\", \"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Amaru: \\u30ab\\u30eb\\u30c0\\u30ce\\u30c8\\u30ec\\u30b8\\u30e3\\u30ea\\u30fc\\u5f15\\u304d\\u51fa\\u3057\\u7533\\u8acb\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafybeicbtr44hbvflshblnn5edxpdji2gdxxw56nv46qwo3bx3bwzxppjy\"}, {\"@language\": \"en\", \"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"PRAGMA Maintainer Committee Framework\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafkreiabxyva5lfm6zztg7tnktxvvbbucljrce7hlrp4p6hropqzfaip3y\"}, {\"@language\": \"en\", \"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Amaru Detailed Budget Proposal for 2025\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafybeicyqwjcg4x52l4ml5ocjlqnproqdjgfbguxdge4saxxvu2hidzvpq\"}, {\"@language\": \"en\", \"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"MLabs's Audit Report of the initial setup\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafybeigwep6tank3l7sewgugsvhykcpy3efkl37bhoba6ukhgfdyg72i54\"}, {\"@language\": \"en\", \"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"TxPipe's Audit Report of the initial setup\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafkreifddblt23n562x35lu4u3mvgafknldof74ync3gd2bbe3nr6rwecm\"}]","metadata_resolved":1,"metadata_hash_valid":1,"proposer_address":"","param_changes":null,"treasury_amount_lovelace":500000000000,"treasury_recipients":"[{\"stake_address\": \"stake1uxrh74lqhhxgzelfsn0wq5kcm4e5dmluprlcpg5mq30p5yq7q27p8\", \"amount\": \"500000000000\"}]","flags":"[{\"flag\": \"\\ud83d\\udfe1 NO_DISCUSSION\", \"severity\": \"yellow\", \"score\": 3, \"detail\": \"No links to forum discussion or community feedback\"}]","flag_score":3,"first_seen":"2026-02-09T18:50:25.950966+00:00","last_updated":"2026-02-09T22:00:01.543836+00:00"},

The period during which this Budget Info Action remains in effect will begin at the close of its voting period and continue for 73 epochs (52 weeks). This budget is an aggregate allocation and following Treasury Withdrawal(s) must be in compliance with an approved and active Net Change Limit, among other conditions. This budget comprises 39 proposals that support maintenance, development, marketing, innovation, and governance initiatives within the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem.\n\nTo arrive at this budget, Intersect facilitated a community budget submission process, using live DRep stake to assess and validate support through the Ekklesia platform. More than 3.8B ada in voting stake participated, representing over 70% of actively delegated stake (excluding pre-defined voting options). A total of 194 proposals were submitted as part of Intersect’s coordination efforts for budget socialization. Projects that received over 50% support by stake from participating DReps, and named Intersect as their Administrator, have been included in this Budget Info Action. Of the 194 proposals submitted, 40 met the required support threshold, and 39 of these named Intersect as their Administrator. Any proposals that proceeded directly on-chain outside of this Budget Info Action have been excluded from ours.\n\nAll proposals listed below have requested Intersect as their Administrator, who will oversee and administer the use of funds from Cardano Blockchain Treasury withdrawals in accordance with this budget and the requirements of the Cardano Constitution. This includes leveraging blockchain technology such as smart contracts as per Article IV, Section 2 in the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Constitution. Intersect, in our role as an Administrator for the included proposals in this aggregate budget, will - wherever possible and available - utilize a smart contract framework to oversee disbursements including a multi-signature oversight body made up of organizations and auditors, one of which will be Intersect in our role as Administrator.","metadata_rationale":"This rationale underpins the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget Info Action - an aggregate allocation of 275,269,340 ada across 39 proposals that each won >50% of participating DRep stake (3.8B ada in live stake >70% of actively delegated stake excluding pre-defined voting options).\n\n**Proposal Intake & Consolidation**\n\nBetween 1 April  – 5 May 2025, the Cardano Budget Committee at Intersect accepted funding requests through two streams:\n\n- Committee “block budgets” connected to several Intersect committees (product, open source, governance, marketing, research) aligned to the vision and product roadmap.\n- Open community submissions from any Cardano contributor, regardless of Intersect membership.\n\nAll 194 submissions followed a standard template (problem, benefits, roadmap alignment, cost) and could be refined with committee feedback, capturing both top-down strategy and bottom-up innovation before DRep review.\n\n**Community Signalling**\n\nDReps and ada holders expressed their preferences in two rounds of off-chain polling: an initial GovTool survey and a final Ekklesia “temperature-check” poll that closed at 23:59 UTC on 5 May 2025. Proposals that garnered over 50% of the participating DRep stake and selected Intersect as their Administrator advanced to this Budget Info Action. The poll artefacts are publicly available (see references below). All proposal content was timestamped at the close of the temperature-check poll and now published to IPFS as part of this on-chain submission, creating an immutable record.\n\n**On-Chain Approval & Oversight**\n\n**Budget Info Action & Net Change Limit**\n\nThe 39 qualifying proposals have been bundled into this single Budget Info Action for DRep ratification. While the total requested funding sits below the Net Change Limit (NCL) currently in force, 350 trillion lovelace, or 350 million ada, as of 8 May 2025, the NCL itself can be amended by a separate Info Action at any time. Consequently, each subsequent Treasury Withdrawal must be presented and approved only if it remains within the then-active NCL, in line with Article IV of the Cardano Constitution and Guardrail: TREASURY-02a.\n\nAlthough all included proposals have requested Intersect as their Administrator, this designation is not automatically guaranteed. Ahead of any Treasury Withdrawal governance action, proposers will be required to undergo due diligence, including KYC/KYB and other background and verification checks. Intersect reserves the right to decline or withdraw its role as Administrator if a proposal fails to meet these requirements, and remains at its discretion.\n\n**Treasury Withdrawal & Fund Management**\n\nOnce ratified, Intersect - named as the Administrator in every proposal included in this budget allocation - will submit Treasury Withdrawal governance action(s) for DReps to approve the release of funds from the Cardano Treasury. Safeguards include:\n\n- Wherever possible and applicable, multi-sig controlled smart-contract decentralized escrow with signers from Intersect, independent auditors, and other appointed bodies. Being developed by Sundae Labs.\n- Disbursements from smart contracts or related accounts will be executed in line with the proposal’s contractual terms and subject to regular oversight, reporting, and - where applicable - milestone acceptance. These will be public via a new community dashboard.\n- Audit and pause-payment capability allow funds to be paused if contractual terms are breached. After arbitration, any undisbursed funds remaining in the smart contract or related accounts will be returned to the Cardano Treasury.\n- On-chain transparency: every payment is publicly traceable, and Intersect’s delivery assurance team working with elected committees will publish progress reports for community oversight.\n\n**Outcome**\n\nThrough community signalling, DRep ratification, adaptable NCL compliance, and smart-contract oversight (wherever applicable and available), Cardano can fund the 2025 roadmap and supporting initiatives confidently - allocating Treasury resources responsibly while retaining the agility to adapt to future economic parameters.\n\nThe provisions set forth in the Cardano Constitution state that the approval of a Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem budget requires a threshold of greater than 50% of the active voting DRep stake and that Constitutional Committee members shall record a vote on-chain that sets forth their opinion as to whether the proposed budget, if it were to be implemented in the form contained in the “Info” action, would violate this Constitution. Therefore, this Budget Info Action will be considered passed with a DRep vote of greater than or equal to 50% +1 lovelace and a Constitutional Committee vote of at least 5 of 7 members.","metadata_motivation":"On March 30, the Cardano community approved the “Defining the Cardano Vision and Roadmap for 2025 and Beyond” Info Action, establishing the foundations for building and anchoring a budget to support its delivery. The budget socialization process - facilitated by Intersect in collaboration with the Cardano community and DRep participation - was designed to be inclusive, with no formal criteria required to take part.

ADA holders, through Delegated Representatives (DReps) and Constitutional Committee oversight, vote on funding proposals within a capped Net Change Limit of 350 million ADA. The process includes two stages: community signaling and a binding on-chain Info Action vote.\nIntersect, a member-based organization, facilitates the process by organizing submissions and offering domain expertise, while final decisions rest with the community. Intersect also serves as the administrator for the use of approved funds.\nCurrent metrics show 11.22B ADA delegated, with 3.92B cast in Ekklesia—72% participation of active voting power. Yet, several proposals advanced without meeting a basic 50 + 1 Lovelace% threshold (2.69B ADA), raising concerns about legitimacy and governance integrity.\nThis info action aim to help community builders to quickly get approval onchain while individually they might not have 100k ADA deposit readily available. We submit all proposals (except founding entity proposals) that have met the 2.69B threshold for inclusion. Without respecting the safeguards put in place within the Cardano Constitution, low-support proposals may continue to pass, risking public confidence within the entire budgetary process. \nThe 2025 budget process reflects Cardano’s Voltaire vision—but its long-term success depends on transparency and accountability aligned with the constitution.","metadata_rationale":"The 2025 Cardano budget process is built to reconcile strategic planning with decentralized authority, ensuring that treasury allocations are community-driven, constitutionally sound, and economically sustainable. It emphasizes transparency, voting legitimacy, and fiscal restraint—all within the framework of the Cardano Constitution and Net Change Limit (NCL).\n\n---\n\n### 1. Proposal Submission & Consolidation\n\nThe process began with dual intake:\n\n- **Block Budgets** from Intersect’s seven working committees (technical, governance, marketing, etc.)\n- **Open Submissions** from any Cardano contributor, regardless of Intersect membership.\n\nAll submissions were standardized—detailing problem, benefit, roadmap alignment, and cost—to ensure fair and structured evaluation. Founding entities (Intersect, IOG, Cardano Foundation, Emurgo) were expected to submit **independent Info Actions** and were **not bundled** with the general budget. This ensures neutrality and reinforces that **this budget includes only community and committee proposals that met threshold—excluding those from founding entities**.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Community Signaling\n\nAn off-chain signaling phase enabled DReps and ADA holders to express preliminary support via GovTool and Ekklesia. Only proposals that achieved **more than 50% approval by voting power** (a minimum of **2.69 billion ADA**, or 50%+1 Lovelace of the 5.38B active voting stake) were advanced to the *Budget Info Action*.\n\nEkklesia recorded just **3.92B in voting participation**, raising concerns that **proposals receiving less than 2.69B ADA in support—but still included—would not represent majority consensus**. This budget seeks to correct that by **excluding all proposals that failed to meet the full quorum** and by **removing founding entity proposals**, even if they surpassed the threshold. This aims to address prior practices resembling **voter engineering or gerrymandering**, where under-supported proposals were pushed through by bundling or procedural manipulation.\n\n---\n\n### 3. On-Chain Budget Approval (Budget Info Action)\n\nProposals that passed community signaling with >2.69B ADA were packaged into this *Budget Info Action* for on-chain ratification. In accordance with **Article IV of the Cardano Constitution**, a valid budget requires:\n\n- A **DRep vote surpassing 50%+1 Lovelace of active voting power** (≥2.69B ADA)\n- A **minimum of 5 out of 7 Constitutional Committee votes** affirming that the budget complies with the Constitution\n- All treasury disbursements to remain **within the 2025 Net Change Limit** (350 million ADA)\n\n---\n\nThis *Budget Info Action* complies with all of the above. DReps now vote knowing that **only proposals that passed the threshold and are constitutionally sound are included**.","metadata_motivation":"The 2025 Cardano budget, established through the Intersect-led process, is designed to ensure Cardano remains secure, competitive, and growth-oriented during this pivotal first year of decentralized, constitutional governance. The total treasury allocation adheres to the community-approved Net Change Limit (NCL) of ₳350 million ada, reflecting our shared commitment to long-term financial sustainability.\nA key issue in the initial budget process was the misapplication of the participation threshold. The 50% + 1 Lovelace threshold was calculated based on total ada participating in the vote, rather than the active voting stake—which significantly alters the democratic weight of participating DReps. This discrepancy risks enabling governance distortion through low-turnout manipulation, akin to gerrymandering.\nTo safeguard against such vulnerabilities and uphold the integrity of Cardano’s governance process, this Info Action includes only those proposals submitted by community builders (that might not have 100k ADA deposit) and met the corrected threshold of 2.69B ada, equivalent to 50% + 1 Lovelace of the active registered voting stake. This ensures that community-driven proposals with broad support are prioritized.\nWe invite the founding entities to formally submit their respective budget proposals for community approval through the same transparent and constitutional mechanisms. This approach preserves fairness, encourages decentralization, and reinforces the principle that all proposals—regardless of origin—must meet the same community-backed standards.\n| Title                                                             | Ekklesia Vote Count Link                                                                                                                                                 | Allocation (ADA) | Ekklesia Vote Count (ADA)      |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Midgard - Optimistic Rollups                                      | [Link](https://2025budget.intersectmbo.org/ballots/680d1b63565577986442d123/proposals/680d1b64565577986442d276)                                                         | 2,162,096        | 3,580,699,128 ADA             |\n| Starstream: next gen VM[t]                                        | [Link](https://2025budget.intersectmbo.org/ballots/680d1b63565577986442d123/proposals/680d1b64565577986442d2ac)                                                         | 2,000,000        | 3,470,904,894 ADA             |\n| Blockfrost Platform community budget proposal | [Link](https://2025budget.intersectmbo.org/ballots/680d1b63565577986442d123/proposals/680d1b63565577986442d14a)                                                                                                                                                                         | 1,300,000        | 3,185,834,713 ADA             |\n| zkFold ZK Rollup                                                  | [Link](https://2025budget.intersectmbo.org/ballots/680d1b63565577986442d123/proposals/680d1b63565577986442d1c4)                                                         | 1,161,000        | 3,202,699,128 ADA             |\n| Hardware Wallets Maintenance                                      | [Link](https://2025budget.intersectmbo.org/ballots/680d1b63565577986442d123/proposals/680d1b64565577986442d2aa)                                                         | 424,800          | 3,431,605,268 ADA             |\n| Ledger App Rewrite                                                | [Link](https://2025budget.intersectmbo.org/ballots/680d1b63565577986442d123/proposals/680d1b63565577986442d202)                                                         | 300,000          | 2,829,275,087 ADA             |\n| Dolos: Sustaining a Lightweight Cardano Data Node                 | [Link](https://2025budget.intersectmbo.org/ballots/680d1b63565577986442d123/proposals/680d1b64565577986442d29a)                                                         | 220,914          | 2,695,223,782 ADA             |\n|                  | Total Allocation                                                         | 7,568,810          |              |\n\n**Total Allocation**: Sum of all proposals that met threshold of 2.69B minus the founding entity proposals\n\n**Bottom line for DReps**: The 2025 budget is guided by one core question: *What mix of spending best transforms Cardano’s roadmap into real-world adoption and long-term resilience—without overspending the treasury?* The proposed allocations reflect the community’s best answer, shaped by 2024 cost data, strategic modeling, and public feedback.\nThis plan **excludes proposals from founding entities** (Intersect, IOG, Cardano Foundation, Emurgo) and **omits any proposal that failed to meet the 2.69B ADA threshold (50% + 1 Lovelace)**—ensuring that only those with clear community support advance.

It covers the whole of 2025.\n\n| Scope                                            | Owner    | Estimated effort | Resources already secured | Resources needed |\n| ---                                              | ---      | ---              | ---                       | ---              |\n| Ledger                                           | Matthias | 2.5 FTEs         | 1 FTE                     | 1.5 FTEs         |\n| Consensus and simulation                         | Arnaud   | 2.5 FTEs         | 1 FTE                     | 1.5 FTEs         |\n| Networking                                       | Santiago | 1 FTE            | 1 FTE                     | 0 FTEs           |\n| Ad-hoc Mercenaries                               | Pi       | 2.5 FTEs         | 0 FTEs                    | 2.5 FTEs         |\n| Project Management, Public Relations & Marketing | Damien   | 0.5 FTEs         | 0 FTEs                    | 0.5 FTEs         |\n\nThe total resources without funding for 2025 adds up to **6 FTEs**. Considering this budget ask is only for **the second half of 2025**, it halves to `$600,000` (600K) once converted to USD (`$`). We then add a 25% contingency budget to cope with our optimistic bias: we are aware that our forecast is subject to underestimating complexity, overlooking challenges, and undervaluing the time and cost required to deliver.\n\nWith this contingency, we end up at **`$750,000` (750K)**. Finally, using a conservative conversion rate of 0.5 ADA (`₳`) per USD (`$`) at the date of the withdrawal, we formulate a budget of **`₳1,500,000` (1.5M)**.\n\n> **NOTE**\n>\n> The Networking scope described in our [design documentation](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru/blob/main/engineering-decision-records/006-design-phase-documentation.md) is included in our proposal for reference but is already covered by a [Catalyst proposal](https://projectcatalyst.io/funds/12/cardano-open-developers/amaru-p2p-networking-component-by-txpipe). It is fully managed by Santiago.\n\n## Administration of the budget\n\nThe [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) maintainer committee will ensure **direct administration** of the budget, assisted with **an on-chain smart contract** (developed in open source, still incomplete, but aimed to be done and fully audited by the time of the first withdrawal).\n\nThe fund management, responsibilities and remuneration of contributors will follow PRAGMA's legal framework provided in annex under [PRAGMA Maintainer Committee Framework](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafkreiabxyva5lfm6zztg7tnktxvvbbucljrce7hlrp4p6hropqzfaip3y).\n\nIn addition, the smart contract's role is to ensure that the expenditure of funds is done in accordance with the scope defined in this budget and authorized by the relevant scope owners.\n\nWe recognize the following capabilities of this contract:\n\n1. **Standard withdrawal**: A scope owner asks other scope owners for money to be withdrawn from his scope.\n2. **Contingency withdrawal**: A scope owner asks other scope owners to withdraw an amount from the contingency funds.\n3. **Scope reconciliation**: A scope owner asks other scope owners for a change of ownership (or a reallocation of budget).\n4. **Contingency refund/closing**: scope owners ask to send the leftovers from the contingency budget to be sent back to the Cardano treasury.\n5. **Credential rotation**: In case of lost credentials or the departure of a scope owner, a mechanism allows the rotation of credentials to a new scope owner upon approval by all (5 out of 5) PRAGMA members (effectively capturing PRAGMA's board decision to appoint new maintainers).\n6. **Failsafe**: In the extreme scenario where credentials would be irremediably lost, thus preventing any further decision, a failsafe mechanism allows all unconsumed funds to be sent back to the Cardano treasury.\n\n## Reporting\n\n#### Quarterly reports\n\nFollowing [PRAGMA's Decision Record 006](https://github.com/pragma-org/PDRs/tree/main/PDR-0006-Project-Reporting), progress on [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) shall be **at least reported quarterly**. The content of [these reports](https://pragma.io/projects/amaru#quarterly-reports) is straightforward and includes the following:\n\n- Problems that require board attention (infrastructure, trademarks, etc.)\n- Project status (active, inactive, initiating, etc.)\n- A changelog (last committer addition)\n- Next planned steps (new releases, significant changes, etc.)\n- Reflection & Performances\n\nThis recurrent interaction will provide an overview of the project with a long-term perspective and support the maintainers' committee in aligning priorities and identifying the next steps. The outcome of these reviews will be publicly available as documentation in [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru)'s GitHub repository.\n\n#### Regular demos\n\nAmaru is demo-driven. We strive to integrate early and provide runnable examples showcasing the latest features as the project is being developed. The cadence for these demos is around 4 to 6 weeks, as illustrated on the [existing track record](https://pragma.io/projects/amaru#demos).\n\nWe will naturally continue to **record and post demos regularly**.\n\n## Constitutionality checklist\n\nBeing one of the first proposals of this nature ever submitted, it is easy to get things wrong. In an effort to convince ourselves of its constitutionality, we thought relevant to include a checklist of the points we cover and for each, our interpretation of the Cardano Constitution.\n\n#### Purpose\n\n- [x] This proposal is for work intended to enhance the security, decentralization and long-term sustainability of Cardano.\n\n#### Article III.5: the process of on-chain governance\n\n- [x] We have submitted this proposal in a standardized, legible format, which includes a URL and hash of all documented off-chain content. We believe our rationale to be detailed and sufficient. The proposal contains a title, abstract, reason for the proposal and relevant supporting materials.\n\n#### Article IV.1: proposing budgets\n\n- [x] This proposal accords with the provisions of this article as it is intended to cover the maintenance and future development of the Cardano Blockchain.\n\n- [x] This proposal covers a shorter period than 73 epochs, which is permitted in this section of the Constitution, to match the Net-Change Limit period.\n\n#### Article IV.2: funds administration\n\n- [x] This proposal specifies an administrator in accordance with this provision. It also specifies an internal administration process using smart contracts and an off-chain overseeing committee, meeting the requirements of this clause, which requires a process that may include an administrator.\n\n#### Article IV.3: Net-Change Limit\n\n- [x] Being of ₳1.5M and covering the second half of 2025, this proposal and the treasury withdrawals it would enable do not violate the currently agreed upon Net-Change Limit.\n\n#### Article IV.4: Auditor\n\n- [x] This proposal makes provisions for an auditor (covered by the _Ad-hoc mercenaries_ scope).\n\n#### Guardrails\n\n- [x] This proposal is subject to _TREASURY-04a_ in that it defines a Cardano blockchain ecosystem budget. It requires a threshold greater than 50% of the DReps' active voting stake to be considered approved and enable subsequent withdrawals pertaining to this budget.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) project represents a major step towards node diversity through the development of a modular, high-performance, and interoperable block-producing node for Cardano. Our approach, rooted in openness, innovation, and operational resilience, aims to deliver significant advancements in blockchain technology without compromising on security.\n\nIn addition to this budget, we provide a detailed document outlining:\n\n- explicit assumptions about the project, the valuation and the scopes covered;\n- comparisons to similar projects of developing blockchain nodes; and\n- the methodology used for managing the project, its deliveries, its finance and its governance.\n\nThrough rigorous design and execution phases, we have outlined actionable scopes, realistic timelines, and comprehensive resource allocations. The detailed breakdown of scopes, funding and resources already secured reflects our commitment to transparency and efficiency. While we remain optimistic about our forecasts, we acknowledge the complexities involved and have incorporated contingencies to address unforeseen challenges.\n\nMore than a mere budget, this proposal is an invitation to collaborate and innovate together. The [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) project is ambitious yet achievable through the collective effort of our contributors and the broader Cardano community. By focusing on building, learning, and demonstrating tangible progress, [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) paves the way for a more resilient and decentralized Cardano ecosystem, ensuring long-term reliability and innovation.\n\nLet's build the future of Cardano together.","metadata_motivation":"## Who we are\n\n[Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) is a multi-entity effort that currently sits under [PRAGMA](https://pragma.io): a member-based, not-for-profit open-source association for blockchain software projects. Five members with equal power currently drive PRAGMA's strategy and operations: Blink Labs, Cardano Foundation, dcSpark, Sundae Labs, and TxPipe. Each of them has a proven track record of building on Cardano and supporting our ecosystem.\n\n[Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) itself is managed by an appointed maintainer committee in charge of different scopes. The current maintainer committee comprises of:\n\n- [Arnaud Bailly](https://github.com/abailly) responsible for the consensus and simulation testing.\n- [Matthias Benkort](https://github.com/ktorz) responsible for the ledger & overall architecture.\n- [Pi Lanningham](https://github.com/Quantumplation) responsible for the ad hoc work and middleware integrations.\n- [Santiago Carmuega](https://github.com/scarmuega) responsible for the p2p networking.\n- [Damien Czapla](https://github.com/Dam-CZ) responsible for the project management, public relations & marketing.\n\nEach member of the maintainer committee is in charge of a scope and has oversight on its delivery, which includes managing an associated budget.\n\n## Why build another node\n\nOne of Cardano's key assets is its legendary robustness and stability, which is mainly attributed to the existing Haskell node, which has been working without significant disruption for about five years now (counting since the Byron reboot, circa February 2020).\n\nSo why bother with another node? The answer is, of course, plural:\n\n#### 1. **Better resource usage**\n\nSoftware is ultimately a collection of design decisions and trade-offs. Some of those trade-offs in the Haskell node have led to rather high resource usages (e.g., resident memory), thus leading to the creation of specific protocol parameters (e.g., min-utxo-value) as countermeasures to ensure resource usage remains somewhat bounded. Our analysis is that different (albeit acceptable) trade-offs would yield better resource usage.\n\n#### 2. **Industry-grade observability**\n\nObservability is challenging, and it is even more so when rolling your own solution. With [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru), we intend to embrace industry standards for monitoring, tracing, and logging to drastically enhance the user experience for operators seeking insights into their node's behaviour.\n\n#### 3. **Enhanced interoperability**\n\n[Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) being primarily written in Rust means that we can more easily leverage an existing and thriving ecosystem of blockchain solutions and aim at multiple target platforms (e.g. web-assembly, RISC-V). This opens up not only to a wide variety of potential contributors but also to many new use cases that are much harder (not to say unrealistic) to achieve with a Haskell node.\n\n#### 4. **Higher-assurance & robustness**\n\nDeveloping a new implementation of existing software means dissecting every part of the original implementation. Along the way, bugs and discrepancies with the specification are commonly found through conformance testing. Gaps in the documentation can also be identified and addressed. The development of [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) has already proven this on several occasions. In the long run, more node implementations can be a synonym for reduced development time by allowing all implementations to converge faster towards better designs and more robust implementations.\n\n#### 5. **Decentralization**\n\nIn a world where Byzantine fault tolerance is at the centre and where decentralization is a paramount value, we believe that a single-node implementation presents a single point of failure and a central point of control. A new node not only increases the overall resilience of the network but also provides perspectives in terms of a roadmap and use cases.\n\n---\n\nWith [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru), we believe that we can reconcile these goals while preserving Cardano's focus on security and robustness. Like Haskell, Rust is a statically typed language that provides strong compile-time guarantees and fine-grained memory management. Its ecosystem is also well-equipped for high assurance, making it a sane choice for implementing blockchain solutions.","metadata_references":"[{\"@language\": \"en\", \"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"PRAGMA Maintainer Committee Framework\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafkreiabxyva5lfm6zztg7tnktxvvbbucljrce7hlrp4p6hropqzfaip3y\"}, {\"@language\": \"en\", \"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Amaru Detailed Budget Proposal for 2025\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafybeicyqwjcg4x52l4ml5ocjlqnproqdjgfbguxdge4saxxvu2hidzvpq\"}, {\"@language\": \"ja\", \"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Cardano\\u30d6\\u30ed\\u30c3\\u30af\\u30c1\\u30a7\\u30fc\\u30f3\\u30fb\\u30a8\\u30b3\\u30b7\\u30b9\\u30c6\\u30e0\\u4e88\\u7b97\\uff1aAmaru 2025\\u5e74\\u5ea6\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafybeihigkjin5njp7fgpehzfh6n4dtzv2xetpxwkwmskzl2xv2zx2fjfu\"}, {\"@language\": \"ja\", \"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Amaru\\u30ce\\u30fc\\u30c9\\u958b\\u767a2025\\u5e74\\u5ea6\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafybeig7w6zfv5zuxrtgmxlr7bzyftjbrsc5pormmjaeg2aqgzx53a5ppq\"}]","metadata_resolved":1,"metadata_hash_valid":1,"proposer_address":"","param_changes":null,"treasury_amount_lovelace":null,"treasury_recipients":null,"flags":"[{\"flag\": \"\\ud83d\\udfe1 NO_DISCUSSION\", \"severity\": \"yellow\", \"score\": 3, \"detail\": \"No links to forum discussion or community feedback\"}]","flag_score":3,"first_seen":"2026-02-09T18:50:25.950966+00:00","last_updated":"2026-02-09T22:00:01.543836+00:00"},

This means passing a NCL in a formal on-chain governance info action. The NCL represents the maximum amount of ada which may be withdrawn from the Cardano Treasury in a given period. It is a guardrail which, by definition in the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Constitution Definitions referenced below, protects the sustainability of the Cardano Treasury by preventing excessive withdrawals.","metadata_rationale":"Article IV, Section I of the Cardano Constitution states: “The Cardano Community may propose one aggregate budget or multiple budgets for the Cardano Blockchain ecosystem. Such budgets are expected to cover not less than a period of 73 epochs (approximately one calendar year) but nothing shall prevent the Cardano Community from proposing budgets for shorter or longer time periods (emphasis added).\n\nAt this time, there are approximately eight (8) months left of 2025. It will take at least 30–60 more days to pass a budget. We believe the NCL for 2025, covering the period from the start of Epoch 532 to the end of Epoch 604, should be 200M ada.\n\nThere are several reasons for this. Members of the Cardano community have generated models showing 350M+/- ada per calendar year was added to the Cardano Treasury in 2024 and therefore, setting NCL at 350M ada preserves the Treasury principal. Regardless of whether such models are accurate, we believe that the community should not set NCL so high at first. There is no reason not to continue to grow the Treasury while the community sorts out its priorities for development and its funding processes.\n\nThis NCL guides the first budget ‘experiment’ of the first ever on-chain Cardano governance. The community has never before been solely responsible for payment to core Cardano developers and has little first-hand knowledge of those expenses. The community is still working out budget processes and evaluating proposed budgets as well as determining appropriate audit and administration methods. For the 2025 year, we should be cautious, while at the same time, permitting use of Treasury funds to continue core maintenance, enhance scaling and other goals. We need to evaluate the impacts to the ecosystem of this funding, the administration of the budget, and the effect of selling 200M ada in a short period of time. We need to let our budget processes mature and to understand risks they may pose to Treasury and the Cardano protocol. A new NCL can and should be set for 2026 after the community has more experience behind it. This may result in an increase, or a decrease, in the limit set in future NCLs.\n\nThis NCL shall be applied to budget actions and treasury withdrawal actions to ensure compliance with Article IV of the Cardano Constitution and the Treasury Withdrawal Guardrails specified in Appendix I.\n\nA vote in favor of this proposal shall indicate agreement with the proposed NCL, allowing for the submission of budget info actions and treasury withdrawal governance actions. The maximum amount that can be withdrawn from the treasury during the specified period shall not exceed the total sum outlined herein.\n\nThe provisions set forth in the Cardano Constitution state that the approval of a NCL requires a threshold of greater than 50% of the active voting DRep stake. Therefore, this NCL will be considered passed if it is greater than 50+1 lovelace%.\n\nIn the event of conflict, this NCL supersedes any prior NCL covering all or part of calendar year 2025.","metadata_motivation":"No funds may be withdrawn from the Cardano Treasury without establishing a NCL.

This governance action serves as an opportunity for all governance stakeholders to formally express their positions regarding the proposed Net Change Limit, ensuring transparency, accountability, and alignment across the ecosystem.\n\nThis Net Change Limit facilitates a yearly budget cycle for the Cardano community. The 2025 Net Change Limit will begin at the start of Epoch 532 and continue for 72 epochs, finishing at the conclusion of Epoch 604 in December 2025. The 2025 Net Change Limit will be 350,000,000,000,000 lovelace (350M ada). This is the maximum amount that can be withdrawn from the treasury during this specific period and shall not be exceeded.\n\nThe Net Change Limit will be used when reviewing both budget actions and treasury withdrawal actions to ensure constitutionality as required by Article IV of the Cardano Constitution and the Treasury Withdrawal Guardrails outlined in Appendix I.","metadata_rationale":"As agreed with the Cardano Budget Committee, the 2025 Net Change Limit shall begin at the start of Epoch 532 and progress for 72 epochs, concluding in December 2025 at the end of Epoch 604.\n\nThe 2025 Net Change Limit shall be set at 350,000,000,000,000 lovelace (350M ada).\n\nThis figure is derived from our modeling, which projected in October 2024 that the treasury would increase by approximately 351M ada across 2024 (epoch 459-531), including all approved withdrawals (e.g., Catalyst). Based on this analysis, the 2025 Net Change Limit was proposed at 350m ada. From January 5th, 2024, Epoch 459, through December 30th, Epoch 531, the actual total income into the Cardano Treasury was 335,957,093 ada. Since this is within 5% of our proposed number, the 2025 Net Change Limit should stay at 350 million ada.\n\nWe propose that the Net Change Limit be set based on the previous year’s total treasury inflows, creating a direct incentive for projects to enhance utility on the blockchain. This approach ensures that funded initiatives drive greater value across the broader ecosystem. We aim to support sustainable growth and long-term advancements within the Cardano network by fostering innovation, efficiency, and real-world applicability.\n\nThis limit shall be applied in assessing budget actions and treasury withdrawal actions to ensure compliance with Article IV of the Cardano Constitution and the Treasury Withdrawal Guardrails specified in Appendix I.\n\nA vote in favor of this proposal shall indicate agreement with the proposed Net Change Limit, allowing for the submission of budget info actions and treasury withdrawal governance actions. The maximum amount that can be withdrawn from the treasury during this specific period shall not exceed the total sum outlined herein.\n\nDuring the socialization of this Net Change Limit, we received feedback from the community that, since the Net Change Limit controls the total amount that can be withdrawn from the treasury in a specified period, the DRep ratification threshold for the Net Change Limit should be set at 67% of the treasury withdrawal parameter percentage. We neither agree nor disagree; however, we recognize that this Net Change Limit must adhere to the guidance outlined in the Cardano Constitution.\n\nThe provisions set forth in the Cardano Constitution state that the approval of a Net Change Limit requires a threshold of greater than 50% of the active voting DRep stake.

The adjustment aims to optimize staking rewards without compromising the financial health of the treasury, ensuring a balanced economic model that incentivizes participation and network security.","metadata_rationale":"## Rationale\n\nThe proposal seeks to reduce the treasury cut from 20% to 10%, increasing staking rewards and incentivizing greater participation in governance. This adjustment strengthens decentralization and network security while maintaining a sustainable treasury.\n\n## Precedent: Plutus V3 Cost Model Update\n\nThe Plutus V3 cost model update demonstrates how governance-driven parameter adjustments can optimize Cardano's economic and technical framework. That update enabled new cryptographic primitives without disrupting existing functionality. This proposal follows a similar structured approach to fine-tune economic incentives while adhering to governance protocols.\n\nRather than equating this action with the Plutus cost model update, it should be framed as a governance-driven economic refinement. The similarity lies in their procedural approach. Both actions modify key parameters through structured governance processes to optimize Cardano's functionality and incentive structures.\n\n## Mathematical Justification\n\nCardano's staking reward system is governed by the formula:\n\n$$ R_{\\text{epoch}} = M \\times (\\text{monetaryExpansion}) + T $$\n\nwhere $`R_{\\text{epoch}}`$ is the total rewards distributed per epoch, $`M`$ represents the remaining ADA reserves, and $`T`$ is the total transaction fees collected in that epoch. The treasury cut is applied before distribution:\n\n$$ R_{\\text{stakers}} = (1 - \\text{treasuryCut}) \\times R_{\\text{epoch}} $$\n\nUnder the current 20% tax:\n\n$$ R_{\\text{stakers}} = 0.80 \\times R_{\\text{epoch}} $$\n\nReducing the tax to 10% results in:\n\n$$ R_{\\text{stakers}} = 0.90 \\times R_{\\text{epoch}} $$\n\nThis equates to a 12.5% increase in staking rewards across the network. Assuming a baseline staking APY of 4.0%, the reduction would increase APY to approximately 4.5%.\n\n## Constitutional Alignment\n\nThe new constitution explicitly permits treasury cuts between 10% and 30% (Appendix I, Section 2.1: TC-01, TC-02). The interim constitution also establishes governance guidelines that align with maintaining financial stability (Article III, Section 3). This governance action remains within those limits and upholds fiscal sustainability principles. It does not alter governance structures but optimizes staking incentives.\n\n## Justification Based on Cardano's Economic Landscape\n\nThis proposal should be justified by Cardano's staking participation rates, treasury utilization, and historical transaction volume. Rather than relying on direct comparisons to external blockchains, the focus should be on positioning Cardano as a highly competitive ecosystem that maximizes staking incentives and treasury efficiency. Ensuring an optimal balance between treasury funding and staking rewards will attract users and developers, particularly during the most competitive phases of market cycles, reinforcing Cardano's long-term adoption and growth.\n\n## Governance Transition Considerations\n\nThe new constitution introduces improved treasury oversight and decentralized decision-making (Article IV, Sections 1-3). This proposal aligns with those mechanisms. It acknowledges the strengthened governance framework and ensures compliance with voting requirements for economic parameter changes.\n\n## Referencing Constitutional Guardrails\n\nThe original 20% treasury cut was an arbitrary level set at the beginning of Shelley and has never been reassessed. It was not based on economic modeling or sustainability projections but rather as a starting point in the early phases of the network. Now, with a more mature ecosystem, this governance action proposes an adjustment to align with long-term realities.\n\nThe primary mechanism that ensures treasury sustainability is **ADA price appreciation** rather than relying solely on transaction volume growth. At significantly higher ADA valuations, the treasury will remain well-funded even with a lower tax rate. This can be expressed as:\n\n$$ T_{\\text{future}} = T_{\\text{current}} \\times \\frac{P_{\\text{future}}}{P_{\\text{current}}} $$\n\nwhere $`T_{\\text{future}}`$ represents the future treasury value, $`T_{\\text{current}}`$ is the current treasury balance, and $`P_{\\text{future}}`$ and $`P_{\\text{current}}`$ represent the future and current price of ADA, respectively.\n\nAt higher ADA valuations, treasury reserves will remain sufficient to fund governance, development, and long-term initiatives without over-relying on a high tax rate. This adjustment strikes a balance between incentivizing participation and ensuring treasury sustainability.\n\n## Benefits to the Ecosystem\n\nReducing the treasury cut increases direct staking incentives, strengthening security by encouraging wider participation in staking. Higher staking rewards improve decentralization, as more ADA holders are motivated to delegate, reducing centralization risks among stake pools.\n\nThis change strengthens staking incentives and decentralization while ensuring the treasury remains well-funded under a sustainable long-term model. The original 20% treasury cut was set arbitrarily at the start of Shelley and has never been adjusted. Now that Cardano has matured, a lower treasury cut realigns incentives with network security and participant rewards.\n\nAt higher ADA prices, the treasury retains substantial purchasing power even with a reduced cut. This can be expressed as:\n\n$$ T_{\\text{future}} = T_{\\text{current}} \\times \\frac{P_{\\text{future}}}{P_{\\text{current}}} + \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\alpha \\cdot T_0 \\cdot (1 + g)^i $$\n\nwhere $`T_{{future}}`$ represents the future treasury value, $`T_{\\text{current}}`$ is the current treasury balance, $`P_{\\text{future}}`$ and $`P_{\\text{current}}`$ represent the future and current price of ADA, and the second term accounts for treasury inflows from transaction fees, where $`\\alpha`$ is the proportion allocated to the treasury, $`T_0`$ is the initial transaction revenue, and $`g`$ is the growth rate of transaction volume.\n\nA lower treasury cut not only increases staking rewards but also shifts economic incentives toward sustainable growth. Developers and projects will be encouraged to build products that drive real transaction activity rather than focusing on treasury allocations as a primary funding source. While increased transaction volume contributes to treasury inflows, the most significant long-term driver of treasury sustainability remains **ADA price appreciation**.\n\nThis adjustment enhances network security, incentivizes ecosystem participation, and promotes a more organic and sustainable approach to funding, ensuring that Cardano remains competitive while maintaining financial stability.\n\n## Governance Efficiency and Competitive Resource Allocation\n\nA leaner treasury encourages competitive grant proposals and more strategic allocation of resources. With a more dynamic and utility-driven economic model, Cardano strengthens its position as an attractive environment for developers and enterprises looking to build scalable blockchain applications.\n\n## Ensuring Continuity and Preventing Disruptions\n\nTo prevent conflicts with the governance transition, this proposal recognizes the role of **DReps, SPOs, and the Constitutional Committee** in treasury management (Article III, Section 2). It remains within the guardrails and economic sustainability principles of both the interim and new constitutional frameworks. A structured review mechanism can be introduced to assess its impact over time and make future adjustments if needed.\n\n## Review and Governance Compliance\n\nThis proposal follows past governance action formats, incorporates economic impact analysis, and ensures alignment with constitutional parameters. It prioritizes Cardano's staking and treasury ecosystem without introducing unnecessary external references. The focus remains on sustainable network incentives and broad economic viability.","metadata_motivation":"The initial 20% treasury cut was set arbitrarily at the launch of Shelley and has never been reassessed. With Cardano's ecosystem maturing and a more structured governance framework in place, it is now possible to refine economic parameters to better align with network incentives. A lower treasury cut increases staking rewards, encourages broader participation, and strengthens security while maintaining a sustainable treasury. This adjustment ensures that governance decisions support long term ecosystem growth.","metadata_references":"[{\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Cardano Interim Constitution\", \"uri\": \"https://github.com/IntersectMBO/draft-constitution/blob/main/2024-12-04/draft-constitution-converted.md\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Cardano New Constitution\", \"uri\": \"https://github.com/IntersectMBO/draft-constitution/blob/main/2024-12-05/draft-constitution-converted.md\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Staking and Rewards Mechanics:\", \"uri\": \"https://docs.cardano.org/about-cardano/learn/delegation\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Cardano Shelley Genesis File\", \"uri\": \"https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-world/blob/51f271a3d6fb1142b167868c506048226ab2021c/docs/environments/mainnet/shelley-genesis.json\"}, {\"@type\": \"Other\", \"label\": \"Cardano Treasury with Kevin Hammond\", \"uri\": \"https://quality-assurance-dao.gitbook.io/community-governance-oversight/catalyst-parameters/governance-parameters/cardano-treasury-with-kevin-hammond\"}]","metadata_resolved":1,"metadata_hash_valid":1,"proposer_address":"","param_changes":"{\"treasury_growth_rate\": 0.1}","treasury_amount_lovelace":null,"treasury_recipients":null,"flags":"[]","flag_score":0,"first_seen":"2026-02-09T18:50:25.950966+00:00","last_updated":"2026-02-09T22:00:01.543836+00:00"},

To give effect to true governance by all ada owners, including on-chain voting, members of the Cardano Community worked together for more than a year, holding global workshops, to ultimately approve a Cardano Improvement Proposal, CIP-1694, that provides a governance system to bring decision making for the Cardano Blockchain network on-chain. CIP-1694 was first published November 18, 2022, as a minimum viable on-chain governance framework. CIP-1694 assures that every ada owner has a voice in Cardano’s governance. Following these global workshops and extensive Cardano Community participation, a refined version of CIP-1694 emerged.\n\nPursuant to CIP-1694, the Cardano Community is now able to present proposals, such as this proposal, to improve and update the Cardano Blockchain network. To enable this, a set of rules, parameters and guardrails must be in place to secure the safety and security of the Cardano Blockchain. CIP-1694 requires that these rules, parameters and guardrails be set out in a constitution that defines Cardano's shared values and guiding principles.\n\n**Chang Hard Fork**\nTwo upgrades (or hard forks) to the Cardano Blockchain protocol were required to fully give effect to CIP-1694. The first upgrade, Chang Hard Fork, was initiated by the Genesis Key Holders and approved by Cardano Blockchain stake pool operators (SPOs) and became effective on September 1, 2024.  The Chang Hard Fork deployed the initial on-chain governance features to the Cardano Blockchain and ushered in an interim (or bootstrap phase) for Cardano Blockchain on-chain governance as described in CIP-1694.\n\nTo give effect to the bootstrap phase of minimum viable on-chain governance, as required by CIP-1694, an interim Cardano Blockchain constitution was published on June 21, 2024.  This interim constitution is a temporary governing document containing only the minimal  requirements necessary for Chang Hard Fork to be implemented.  The bootstrap phase also required that an interim Constitutional Committee be elected by the Cardano Community. Once the Cardano Constitution is approved pursuant to an on-chain vote, the interim constitution will be replaced.  The term of the interim Constitutional Committee members expires in September 2025 (Epoch 580) and at that time the Cardano Community will be able to elect a new Constitutional Committee.\n\n**Plomin Hard Fork**\nThe second upgrade (or intra-era hard fork) to the Cardano Blockchain moved CIP-1694 out of the interim bootstrap phase and into full minimum viable on-chain governance as described in CIP-1694. To fully implement on-chain governance, the Cardano Community will now need to ratify this proposed Cardano Constitution on-chain.\n\n**Achieving Consensus on the Cardano Constitution**\nOn behalf of the Cardano Community, the Constitution Ratification Working Group (CRWG) of the Cardano Civics Committee of Intersect brought together representatives of the Cardano Community, blockchain governance and constitutional scholars and the Cardano Parameter Committee to develop the Cardano Constitution.\n\nUsing the Interim Constitution as a starting point, this group prepared a first draft of a constitution that was then submitted in July 2024 to representatives from the Cardano Community who volunteered to participate in a series of global community workshops. Between July and October 2024, 63 workshops were held in over 50 countries and involved more than 1,400 participants.\n\nEach workshop, as well as others from the Cardano Community via an online open form, reviewed and provided feedback and recommendations on the July draft. Each workshop also elected a Constitutional Delegate and Alternate to represent the views of their workshop at the Constitutional Convention.\n\nAs part of helping to organize the 63 global workshops, the CRWG identified the most complex issues that arose from the initial drafting process. The CRWG asked workshops to provide feedback on these issues. Each workshop chose which issues they particularly wanted to focus on. Output from the workshops, together with open-ended community feedback, shaped the edits that were made to the July draft.\n\nThe workshop data was reviewed by the CRWG and Parameter Committee, as well as the group of blockchain governance and constitutional scholars and turned into proposed revisions. The Delegates and Alternates met in a series of online and in-person workshops to synthesize the output from the global workshops and review the resulting proposed revisions to the draft Constitution. In these workshops, Delegates were asked to review the proposed changes in light of their workshop’s feedback and work as a group to settle on the best path forward. This often took the form of debates, problem solving, and compromise. Using that output, the Delegates and Alternates, again working with the CRWG, the Parameter Committee and a group of blockchain governance and constitutional scholars, revised the July draft constitution. That work resulted in a subsequent 20 November 2024 draft constitution that was released to the Cardano Community.\n\nBased on further community feedback, the Delegates and Alternates continued to review and make additional revisions to the November draft. They also took into consideration other community input including a draft constitution that was published by the Cardano Foundation and based on the November draft. Delegates, Alternates and other Cardano Community members continued to iterate on the draft constitution until reaching final consensus at the Constitutional Convention. The proposed Cardano Constitution was overwhelmingly approved by the Delegates at the Constitutional Convention by a 95% margin. On that basis, the Delegates and CRWG are putting forward this governance action for consideration by all owners of ada.\n\nNevertheless, the CRWG, the Delegates, Alternates and others involved in the drafting process all recognize that the proposed Cardano Constitution is not perfect. It is not an end, only the beginning. Over time, as all those involved to date recognize, the Cardano Constitution may need to be revised and improved. The Cardano Constitution also acknowledges this by providing an amendment process.\n\nFurther, in the Delegate synthesis workshops, the Delegates and Alternates identified a number of future governance workstreams. The Cardano Community will be invited to organize and participate during 2025 in various future governance workshops. These future workshops will focus on various governance considerations such as governance processes and procedures that should not appropriately be included in a constitution, governance processes that the Constitution requires the community to implement to give effect to various constitutional mandates, and potential future amendments to the Constitution that may become appropriate based on review and feedback as to how governance processes are working.","metadata_references":"[{\"label\": \"Delegate Approved Constitution up for vote\", \"@type\": \"Other\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafkreiazhhawe7sjwuthcfgl3mmv2swec7sukvclu3oli7qdyz4uhhuvmy\"}, {\"label\": \"Definitions for the Delegate Approved Constitution \", \"@type\": \"Other\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafkreiewp5bgrdiesq6ft3qypykgcjhvfgpp4s5o4yrjrvko4wuhi4iecu\"}, {\"label\": \"Supporting information about the Delegate Approved Constitution\", \"@type\": \"Other\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafybeidf4rqxgodfaajo3zwzcofyys4sl7dns4fsflq7c2tmjrvc3f7hqm\"}, {\"label\": \"Draft constitution provided to the Constitutional Workshops\", \"@type\": \"Other\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafybeigrg4ew43et23kgphs24flf4rspw2gpylus5ztuikwhxewg66pz5u\"}, {\"label\": \"Issues presented to the Constitutional Workshops for debate and input\", \"@type\": \"Other\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafkreiaahkoi43kzobyurdnbssgntoxr3ewv4qehqvb5jcn4ytfa3w326m\"}, {\"label\": \"1,400 Constitutional Workshop participants \", \"@type\": \"Other\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafybeifbd5d4apao7h73ydlyirikmrzqhxhqa6qxgu4dny5d3qssl2vcry\"}, {\"label\": \"63 Constitutional Workshop results\", \"@type\": \"Other\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafybeihvj5mviuivmsw2n72xgzuix2rug774fqlmdz7yjzgsxextvj7ywu\"}, {\"label\": \"Constitutional Delegate Synthesis Workshops\", \"@type\": \"Other\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafkreib5dlpmkngxee2w36gj2tuzy7csvsqkpd37d2qpxbhqktm7joocoi\"}, {\"label\": \"20 November 2024 Draft Constitution\", \"@type\": \"Other\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafybeia27ykgiihzdiwapu3vgfpb4utljpkchikvsc25lusw45w2jgs5le\"}, {\"label\": \"Constitutional Convention Archivist Notes, December 4, 2024\", \"@type\": \"Other\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafybeiglsbn26td6t5zc2tbaat3hhghiawaq4n5l5o5xljv3z566voyn5u\"}, {\"label\": \"Constitutional Convention Archivist Notes, December 5, 2024\", \"@type\": \"Other\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafybeie2ycw6voupzeg3tfs6bthnnczek5e6573kshlnhxfql6javv2xcq\"}, {\"label\": \"Constitutional Convention Archivist Notes, December 6, 2024\", \"@type\": \"Other\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafybeidaqbljnelwxkojp4mek3dgav3tjgosxboloa7wplmmz45xhb23gq\"}, {\"label\": \"Cardano Transaction Hash of the Constitutional Convention Vote\", \"@type\": \"Other\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafkreiawz7kwlnehgatptxcol4cijanjhf3xpoweplhfivtpxlq5wuaowa\"}, {\"label\": \"List of contributors to the Cardano Constitution\", \"@type\": \"Other\", \"uri\": \"ipfs://bafkreicnb6jengfum7mk6yrac5kzurf2q2ajm2ekk4b2tu2hddmmvzumtm\"}]","metadata_resolved":1,"metadata_hash_valid":1,"proposer_address":"","param_changes":null,"treasury_amount_lovelace":null,"treasury_recipients":null,"flags":"[{\"flag\": \"\\ud83d\\udfe1 NO_DISCUSSION\", \"severity\": \"yellow\", \"score\": 3, \"detail\": \"No links to forum discussion or community feedback\"}]","flag_score":3,"first_seen":"2026-02-09T18:50:25.950966+00:00","last_updated":"2026-02-09T22:00:01.543836+00:00"},

Phil Chang was an employee of Input Output who made significant contributions to Cardano’s governance system to help transfer control and responsibility of the blockchain into the hands of the community. Matthew Plomin was an exemplar of the Cardano community, representing every individual who stands ready to pick up the torch and carry the ecosystem forward.\n\nMatthew was a much loved and respected member of the Cardano community. He passed unexpectedly on November 14th, 2024. Originally hailing from Indiana, USA; he earned a Bachelor of Science in Management degree from Purdue University where he met and married the love of his life, Jillian (Shaw). He went on to receive his Master of Business Administration Degree from George Washington University before joining the DWS Group (Deutsche Bank) and rising to the Head of the US Money Market Credit Research team. His expertise in the traditional finance world was instrumental in his journey to found $USDM, a Cardano-native stable coin pegged to the US Dollar and fully backed by dollar reserves.\n\nAs a Cardano community member, Matthew was always eager to learn more and excited to help others work through issues they encountered with their projects in the ecosystem. He taught himself how to mint native assets, experimenting with social games and helping Jillian to publish a book she authored in a serialized, token-based format. Seeing the need for a US Dollar-backed Stablecoin on Cardano, Matthew assembled a team that would become the Moneta project. Despite limited institutional backing during a market bottom, the community stepped up to champion him and their support helped his dream become a reality.\n\nMatthew leaves behind his wife, Jillian, their seven children, and the Moneta team. His legacy lives on through the work that he accomplished and the inspiration that he kindled in others. As a devout Roman Catholic Christian, Matthew lived out the “Golden Rule” to “do unto others as you would have them do unto you,” and the world is a better place for him being in it.","metadata_motivation":"There is a tradition of naming hard forks in memory of notable historical figures or significant contributors to the Cardano community.

Existing Plutus cost model settings will not be changed.  Note that the primitives will not be enabled in Protocol version 9 (as enabled by the Chang hard fork).","metadata_rationale":"We propose to update the Plutus V3 Cost Model via a Parameter Update governance action to enable the new Plutus primitives that will be available following the Chang #2 hard fork (to Protocol Version 10).  Existing Plutus cost model settings will not be changed.  Note that the new primitives will not be enabled in Protocol version 9 (as enabled by the Chang hard fork). \n\n## Technical Evaluation\n\nThe changes described in this governance action have been recommended by Intersect’s Parameter Committee on 2024-10-10, as evidenced by [this post in the Cardano Forum](https://forum.cardano.org/t/oct-10-2024-voltaire-era-parameter-committee-intermediate-state/137361), and subsequently ratified unanimously by Intersect's Technical Steering Committee on 2024-10-18.\n\n\n### Functionality\n\nAs described below, 12 new Plutus v3 primitives will be enabled following the Chang#2 hard fork. These will provide new bitwise and cryptographic hashing functions that have a variety of uses, and which will enhance interoperability with BitCoin and Ethereum.  The revised Plutus v3 cost model will enable those new primitives.  The changes are all additions to the existing Plutus V3 cost model.  No changes will be made to the cost model values for any existing Plutus primitives or to the Plutus V1 and V2 cost nodels.\n### Security\n\n\nNo specific security concerns are raised by this change. A security report will be provided for the new Plutus primitives to support the Chang#2 hard fork.\n\n\n### Performance\n\nIn line with [Plutus benchmarking procedures](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/plutus/blob/master/plutus-core/cost-model/CostModelGeneration.md), [standard benchmarking has been undertaken on a reference machine](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/plutus/blob/master/plutus-core/cost-model/data/benching-conway.csv) to determine these cost model settings and to align them with existing Plutus primitives.  Since Plutus script execution times and memory usage are bounded by `maxBlockExecutionUnits[steps/memory]` and `maxTxExecutionUnits[steps/memory]`, there will be no overall performance impact on the node from these new cost model settings.\n\n### Sustainability\n\nThe upgrade provides new Plutus functionality that will enhance its bitwise and cryptographic capabilities and provide better interoperability with BitCoin and Ethereum.\n\n## New Plutus Primitives that will be Enabled after the Chang#2 Hard Fork\n\n\nThe new Plutus primitives are defined in three CIPs: [CIP-0122](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-0122), [CIP-0123](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-0123) and [CIP-0127](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-0127).\n\n### CIP-0122\nBitwise operations, both over fixed-width and variable-width blocks of bits, have a range of uses, including data structures (especially succinct ones) and cryptography. Currently, operations on individual bits in Plutus Core are difficult, or outright impossible, while also keeping within the tight constraints required on-chain. While it is possible to some degree to work with individual bytes over BuiltinByteStrings, this isn't sufficient, or efficient, when bit manipulations are required.\n\nThe new Plutus primitives defined by CIP-0122 are:\n\n- Bitwise logical AND, OR, XOR and complement;\n- Reading a bit value at a given index;\n- Setting bits value at given indices; and\n- Replicating a byte a given number of times.\n\n> ``\n> andByteString, orByteString, xorByteString, complementByteString, readBit, writeBits, replicateByte\n> ``\n\n### CIP-0123\nThe new bitwise operations that are defined in CIP-0123 extend the set that is provided by CIP-0123 to provide a usefully 'complete' set of bitwise operations.\n\nThe new Plutus primitives defined by CIP-0123 are:\n\n- Bit shifts and rotations\n- Counting the number of set bits (popcount)\n- Finding the first set bit\n\n> ``\n> shiftByteString,\n> rotateByteString,\n> countSetBits,\n> findFirstSetBit\n> ``\n\n\n### CIP-0127\nThe integration of the ECDSA and Schnorr signatures over the secp256k1 curve into Plutus was a significant step towards interoperability with the Ethereum and Bitcoin ecosystems. However, full compatibility is still impossible due to the absence of the RIPEMD-160 hashing algorithm in the Plutus interpreter. This is a fundamental component of Bitcoin's cryptographic framework.\n\nAdding RIPEMD-160 support to Plutus enhances the potential for cross-chain solutions between Cardano and Bitcoin blockchains and complements the set of primitives which are already available. It will allow for the verification of Bitcoin addresses and transactions on-chain. This addition also enables the verification of signed messages that identify the signer by the public key hash, which has not yet been witnessed on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nThe new Plutus primitive defined by CIP-0127 is:\n\n- [RIPEMD-160 hashing](https://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~bosselae/ripemd160/pdf/AB-9601/AB-9601.pdf)\n\n> ``\n> ripemd_160\n> ``\n\nEach of the new primitives has both CPU and memory unit cost models.\n\n\n## Differences to the current Plutus cost model that will be enacted by this governance action.\n\n\nThe full difference from the current on-chain Plutus V3 cost model settings is shown below.  These changes are all additions to the existing Plutus V3 cost model.

The K parameter determines the saturation of stakepools. To calculate the saturation of stakepools you can take the total number of ADA and divide it by K. K is currently 500, and pool saturation is currently 74,551,771.86 ADA. Pool saturate will increase slightly each epoch as more ADA is minted each epoch from staking rewards.\n\nK also has a large effect on a0. a0 is another Cardano protocol paramter that determines ADA staking rewards per epoch. a0 is currently set at .3. If a stakepool operator pledges the enough ADA to saturate their pool they earn 30% more ADA rewards per epoch. If you pledge half of the pools saturation then any delegates earn 15% more ADA rewards after SPO fees. Smaller pledges have a higher impact on staking rewards with a k parameter that's higher.","metadata_rationale":"We believe that it's important to submit governance info actions to encourage community participation in Cardano's governance before larger, and potentially more serious proposals are introduced.
