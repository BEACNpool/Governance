# BEACN DRep Metadata Anchor

This folder contains the **public metadata** for the BEACN DRep registration.

## Anchor URLs

### DRep registration anchor (CIP-100 style)
Use this raw URL as the **Anchor URL** in the registration/update flow (when asked for a metadata anchor):

- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BEACNpool/Governance/main/drep/metadata.json

### GovTool DRep Directory profile file (CIP-119 style)
Some UIs provide a downloadable CIP-119 JSON template for the DRep directory profile.
If you are asked to host that file and paste a public URL, use:

- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BEACNpool/Governance/main/drep/drep-directory.json

## What this is

A receipts-first DRep profile describing BEACN’s governance ethos:
- **Givers, Not Takers**
- **Public money demands public receipts**
- **Flags ≠ fraud** (signals for missing/weak proof)

## Edit policy

If this metadata is updated, it should be:
- committed to `main`
- linked from reports (optional)
- referenced in a dated snapshot when relevant
