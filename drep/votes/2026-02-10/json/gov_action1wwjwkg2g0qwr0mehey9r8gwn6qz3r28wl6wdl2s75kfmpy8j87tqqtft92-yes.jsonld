  "rationale": "(as submitted)\n\nI’m voting YES because establishing a clear Net Change Limit (NCL) for a defined period is a constitutional / process requirement and this proposal is reasonable, data-anchored, and time-aligned with treasury planning.\n\nWhy YES\n\n- Meets the governance need: An NCL must be set for a specific period so the ecosystem has an explicit, auditable constraint on net treasury change. Approving an NCL avoids ambiguity and ad‑hoc decision-making.\n- Prudent fiscal discipline: 300,000,000 ADA is set by reference to the prior year’s actual treasury inflows (Epochs 532–604) totaling 306,940,195 ADA. Setting the NCL slightly below that figure is conservative and supports sustainability.\n- Good timing window (613–713): The proposed range aligns the NCL cycle with the mid‑year budget season, and ensures a complete prior year of inflow data is available when the next NCL is set—improving predictability and legitimacy of future budgeting.\n- Predictability for builders + voters: A clearly defined cap for a long window improves planning for treasury-funded work while preserving an explicit limit that voters can enforce.\n\nNotes / expectations\n\n- This is an Info Action establishing the NCL; it doesn’t approve any specific spending by itself.\n- Future treasury withdrawals should continue to be evaluated on deliverables, milestones, and public receipts, within the approved NCL.",
