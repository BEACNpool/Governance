  "rationale": "(as submitted)\n\nRationale (NEEDS MORE INFO / ABSTAIN) — Cardano DeFi Liquidity Budget: Withdrawal 1 (₳500,000)\n\nI support the goal of building accountable infrastructure for a community-approved DeFi liquidity program, and I appreciate the inclusion of a multisig administration concept and a dedicated third-party security audit budget. However, I cannot approve releasing treasury funds at this time because critical execution details and accountability signals are incomplete or inconsistent.\n\nIn particular, the listed receiving address is a stake address (needs a clear payment/script address), the proposal metadata does not clearly identify accountable authors/signers, and the legal/operational structure (Cayman FC + interim committee + service providers) requires clearer, verifiable milestone acceptance criteria and transparent conversion/payment methodology.\n\nI will reconsider a YES once the receiving script address and multisig setup are unambiguously specified, committee/signers are disclosed with governance controls, milestones are made objectively verifiable, and audit/open-source commitments are locked in with links and timelines.",
