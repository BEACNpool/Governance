  "rationale": "(as submitted)\n\nI’m voting ABSTAIN because I see legitimate arguments on both sides: improving governance liveness is important, but reducing the minimum operating size can also increase perceived capture risk if the committee ever operates while underfilled.\n\n### Why ABSTAIN\n\n- **Liveness benefit is real:** With a minimum of 7, routine events like resignations, recusals, illness, or temporary unavailability can make the CC unable to function, creating avoidable governance fragility.\n- **Capture concern is also real:** Under the CIP-1694 design, CC approval is based on meeting a committee threshold (a fraction of CC “Yes” votes) among active members, and committeeMinSize determines when the CC can still participate. Allowing the CC to operate at 5 can reduce the number of independent people needed to clear the threshold during vacancy periods, which can strengthen any coordinated bloc if the committee is ever underfilled.\n- **Community sentiment favors anti-capture posture:** Given ongoing concerns that concentrated influence already exists, I prefer not to reduce the minimum operating size without additional, explicit safeguards (e.g., clear vacancy-filling expectations, stronger operational continuity measures, and/or threshold settings that preserve broad consent even when membership is reduced).\n\n### What would change my vote\n\nI would consider YES if accompanied by clearer commitments/mechanisms that keep capture risk low during underfilled periods—such as time-bound replacement processes, transparency around recusals/vacancies, and assurance that the effective CC approval requirements remain robust even if membership temporarily drops.\n\nReference: https://cips.cardano.org/cip/CIP-1694",
