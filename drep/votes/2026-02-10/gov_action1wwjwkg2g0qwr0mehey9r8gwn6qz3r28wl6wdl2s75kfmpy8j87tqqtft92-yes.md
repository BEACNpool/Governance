## Rationale (as submitted)

I’m voting YES because establishing a clear Net Change Limit (NCL) for a defined period is a constitutional / process requirement and this proposal is reasonable, data-anchored, and time-aligned with treasury planning.

Why YES

- Meets the governance need: An NCL must be set for a specific period so the ecosystem has an explicit, auditable constraint on net treasury change. Approving an NCL avoids ambiguity and ad‑hoc decision-making.
- Prudent fiscal discipline: 300,000,000 ADA is set by reference to the prior year’s actual treasury inflows (Epochs 532–604) totaling 306,940,195 ADA. Setting the NCL slightly below that figure is conservative and supports sustainability.
- Good timing window (613–713): The proposed range aligns the NCL cycle with the mid‑year budget season, and ensures a complete prior year of inflow data is available when the next NCL is set—improving predictability and legitimacy of future budgeting.
- Predictability for builders + voters: A clearly defined cap for a long window improves planning for treasury-funded work while preserving an explicit limit that voters can enforce.

Notes / expectations

- This is an Info Action establishing the NCL; it doesn’t approve any specific spending by itself.
- Future treasury withdrawals should continue to be evaluated on deliverables, milestones, and public receipts, within the approved NCL.
