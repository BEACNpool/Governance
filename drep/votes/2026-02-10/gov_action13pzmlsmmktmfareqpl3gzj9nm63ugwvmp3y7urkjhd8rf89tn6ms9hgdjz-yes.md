## Rationale (as submitted)

I’m voting YES because this is a low-risk, non-monetary commemorative naming decision that appropriately honors a meaningful Cardano community contributor and continues an established network tradition.

Why YES

- Appropriate for an Info Action: This proposal does not change protocol parameters or treasury flows; it’s a community-facing naming decision with minimal operational risk.
- Continuity with Cardano tradition: Cardano has consistently named eras/hard forks to recognize key figures and respected community members (e.g., Vasil, Chang, Plomin). “van Rossem” fits that precedent.
- Genuine community impact: The rationale credibly documents Max van Rossem’s contributions across governance and community building—constitution work, CC election working group leadership, Dutch DRep collective participation, and ecosystem projects (e.g., AdaMoments).
- Positive cultural signal: Recognizing service and constructive leadership reinforces the values Cardano wants to promote: civic contribution, governance stewardship, and community cohesion.

Bottom line: This is a respectful memorial naming aligned with precedent and carries essentially no technical downside, so YES.
