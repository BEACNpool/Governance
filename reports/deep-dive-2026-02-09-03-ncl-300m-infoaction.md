# Deep Dive — 2026-02-09 — Net Change Limit (NCL) 300M ADA for Epochs 613–713

> **AI Deep Dive (analysis)** — links included so anyone can verify.

## 0) One-paragraph summary
This is an **InfoAction** proposing a **Net Change Limit (NCL)** of **300 million ADA** for a defined epoch range. NCL is a guardrail concept that constrains how much treasury can change over time; it doesn’t directly send funds, but it shapes what future treasury withdrawals are possible.

## 1) Why this matters
- Delegators should care because NCL effectively limits (or enables) future spending.
- Too low can starve ecosystem investment; too high can reduce fiscal restraint.

## 2) Primary receipts

- Anchor (IPFS): ipfs://bafkreid7tr5uotr4bp2jp54q7lbm5p5eldncuahprj53msy6kqgjscyrdu

## 3) What to look for
- Does the anchor justify the number (300M) with:
  - treasury size, expected inflows/outflows
  - planned budgets
  - risk management
- Is the epoch range correct and aligned with governance cadence?

## 4) Risks / concerns
- InfoActions can be used as “soft commitments”; they still shape expectations.
- If this NCL is set without broad understanding, it can become political ammo later.

## 5) Questions to ask publicly
1) What model/data supports 300M ADA specifically?
2) How does it compare to previous periods (if any) and to Catalyst + other programs?
3) If set, how will the community revisit/adjust it?

## 6) My recommendation (clearly labeled)
**Recommendation: NEEDS MORE INFO, lean YES only if the justification is solid.**
A guardrail is useful, but the number must be grounded in treasury reality, not vibes.

## 7) Change log
- First draft created 2026-02-09.
