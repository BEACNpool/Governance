# Recipient/Entity Leaderboard — 2026-02-09

Aggregated view of who received (or was authorized to receive) funds across indexed mechanisms.

**Caveats**
- TreasuryWithdrawals: aggregated by *recipient stake address* from on-chain withdrawal maps (good).
- Intersect Grants: aggregated by *page title* (v1). Next improvement is parsing grantee legal entity names.
- This is not an accusation list; it’s a ‘follow the money’ index.
