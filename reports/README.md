# Reports

This folder contains human-readable outputs generated from the data snapshots.

## Conventions

- `*-latest.html` files are pointers to the most recent report of that type.
- Dated reports use `YYYY-MM-DD` in filenames.

## Key pages

- `methodology-doge.html` — how flags are produced (flags ≠ fraud)
- `community-summary-*.html` — plain-language overview
- `waste-deep-dive-*.html` — deep dive into currently-flagged items
